  abstract = {Consider the following questions: (1) If we manipulate one species in a food web will this change the population of species that neither eat nor are eaten by the manipulated species? (2) If removing species A in food web 1 causes a 20\% decrease in species B, can we assume that a similar decrease of B will occur if we remove species A in web 2, which contains a number of species not found in web 1? The answer to these sorts of questions depend a great deal on the importance of indirect interactions in food webs. If the effect of one species on the density of another tends to diminish with their separation in the food web (measured by number of feeding links in the shortest path connecting the two species), then it may be possible to ignore at least some indirect effects. Under this scenario where affects are attenuated by distance in the food web, we would expect either prey or predators of the focal species to be most affected by a change in the rate of harvest of the focal species.},

This question has been challenged by the observation of emergent coexistence, where microbial communities contain species that cannot coexist in pairs, suggesting the presence of non-pairwise mechanisms. Instead, we show that emergent coexistence arises naturally in species-rich models with pairwise interactions. Strikingly, this phenomenon does not require additional mechanisms like intransitive or higher-order interactions; rather, coexistence arises from dense networks of indirect effects. As diversity increases, we show that indirect effects become so intricate that pairwise interactions no longer predict community composition, revealing a fundamental limit to reductionist explanations of coexistence. Like chaos emerging from simple rules, our findings provide theoretical foundations to understand how unexpected species coexistence can emerge from pairwise interactions.},

  abstract = {How can so many species coexist in natural ecosystems remains a fundamental question in ecology. Classical models suggest that competition for space and resources should maintain the number of coexisting species far below the staggering diversity commonly found in nature. To overcome this paradox, theoretical studies have long highlighted a number of mechanisms that can favour species coexistence, from the distribution of interaction strengths between species to the shape of population growth functions. In particular, a family of mathematical models finds that, when sublinear population growth (SG) rates are coupled with competition between species, species diversity can stabilize community dynamics. This could suggest that SG may explain the stable coexistence of many species in natural ecosystems. Here we clarify why SG models do not solve the paradox of species coexistence. This is because, in the SG model, coexistence emerges from an unrealistic property, in which population per capita growth rates tend to infinity at low abundance, preventing species from ever going extinct due to competitive exclusion. Infinite growth at low abundance can be regularized by assuming a minimal abundance threshold, below which a species goes extinct or follows non-infinite growth curves. When this is done, the SG model recovers the classical result: increasing the diversity of the species pool leads to competitive exclusion and species extinctions.},

Here we develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary framework which features more detailed species interactions, integrating evolution and dispersal. We include species interactions within and between trophic levels, and additionally, we incorporate the feature that species' interspecific competition might change due to increasing temperatures and affect the impact of climate change on ecological communities. Our modeling framework captures previously reported ecological responses to climate change, and also reveals two key results. First, interactions between trophic levels as well as temperature-dependent competition within a trophic level mitigate the negative impact of climate change on biodiversity, emphasizing the importance of understanding biotic interactions in shaping climate change impact. Second, our trait-based perspective reveals a strong positive relationship between the within-community variation in preferred temperatures and the capacity to respond to climate change. Temperature-dependent competition consistently results both in higher trait variation and more responsive communities to altered climatic conditions. Our study demonstrates the importance of species interactions in an eco-evolutionary setting, further expanding our knowledge of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes.},

  abstract = {Human-induced environmental changes have a direct impact on species populations, with some species experiencing declines while others display population growth. Understanding why and how species populations respond differently to environmental changes is fundamental to mitigate and predict future biodiversity changes. Theoretically, species life-history strategies are key determinants shaping the response of populations to environmental impacts. Despite this, the association between species life histories and the response of populations to environmental changes has not been tested. In this study, we analysed the effects of recent land-cover and temperature changes on rates of population change of 1,072 populations recorded in the Living Planet Database. We selected populations with at least 5 yearly consecutive records (after imputation of missing population estimates) between 1992 and 2016, and for which we achieved high population imputation accuracy (in the cases where missing values had to be imputed). These populations were distributed across 553 different locations and included 461 terrestrial amniote vertebrate species (273 birds, 137 mammals, and 51 reptiles) with different life-history strategies. We showed that populations of fast-lived species inhabiting areas that have experienced recent expansion of cropland or bare soil present positive populations trends on average, whereas slow-lived species display negative population trends. Although these findings support previous hypotheses that fast-lived species are better adapted to recover their populations after an environmental perturbation, the sensitivity analysis revealed that model outcomes are strongly influenced by the addition or exclusion of populations with extreme rates of change. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. With climate and land-use changes likely to increase in the future, establishing clear links between species characteristics and responses to these threats is fundamental for designing and conducting conservation actions. The results of this study can aid in evaluating population sensitivity, assessing the likely conservation status of species with poor data coverage, and predicting future scenarios of biodiversity change., In this work, we showed how fast-lived species populations present positive population growth rates in areas that have experienced recent temperature and land-use changes. Whereas populations of slow-lived species showed the opposite response.},

Each species along these chains is responsible for passing energy to the taxa that follow it, and, as such, it is indispensable for their survival; because of this it is said to dominate them. The higher the number of species a node dominates, the greater the impact resulting from its removal. By computing dominator trees for 13 well-studied food webs we obtained for each of them the number of nodes dominated by a single species and the number of nodes that dominate each species. We illustrate the procedure for the Grassland Ecosystem showing the potential of this method for identifying species that play a major role in energy delivery and are likely to cause the greatest damage if removed. Finally, by means of two indices that measure error and attack sensitivity, we confirm a previous hypothesis that food webs are very robust to random loss of species but very fragile to the selective loss of the hubs.},

It underlies classifications in evolution and ecology, including those used to describe phylogenetic levels, the habitat and functional roles of organisms in ecosystems.

We present here the simplest possible model based on groups, and show that it performs substantially better than current models at predicting the structure of large food webs. Our group-based model can be applied to different types of biological and non-biological networks, and for the first time merges in the same framework two important notions in network theory: that of compartments (sets of highly interacting nodes) and that of roles (sets of nodes that have similar interaction patterns). This model provides a basis to examine the significance of groups in biological networks and to develop more accurate models for ecological network structure. It is especially relevant at a time when a new generation of empirical data is providing increasingly large food webs.},

Recently, tools from random matrix theory have identified the main drivers of stability in ecological communities whose network structure is random. However, empirical food webs differ greatly from random graphs. For example, their degree distribution is broader, they contain few trophic cycles, and they are almost interval. Here we derive an approximation for the stability of food webs whose structure is generated by the cascade model, in which `larger' species consume `smaller' ones. We predict the stability of these food webs with great accuracy, and our approximation also works well for food webs whose structure is determined empirically or by the niche model. We find that intervality and broad degree distributions tend to stabilize food webs, and that average interaction strength has little influence on stability, compared with the effect of variance and correlation.},

Riverine ecosystems, however, have been for a long time viewed from a local or linear perspective, even though the treelike branching of river networks is universal. River networks (so-called dendritic networks) are not only structured in a hierarchic way, but the dendritic landscape structure and physical flows often dictate distance and directionality of dispersal. Theoretical models suggest that the specific riverine network structure directly affects diversity patterns. Recent experimental and comparative data are supporting this idea. Here, I provide an introduction on theoretical findings suggesting that genetic diversity, heterozygosity and species richness are higher in dendritic systems compared to linear or two-dimensional lattice landscapes. The characteristic diversity patterns can be explained in a network perspective, which also offers universal metrics to better understand and protect riverine diversity. I show how appropriate metrics describing network centrality and dispersal distances are superior to classic measures still applied in aquatic ecology, such as Strahler order~or Euclidian distance. Finally, knowledge gaps and future directions of research are identified. The network perspective employed here may help to generalize findings on riverine biodiversity research and can be applied to conservation and river restoration projects.},

We studied the diets, productivity, and density of breeding Bald Eagles on four islands during 1993--1994 and 2000--2002, when sea otters were abundant and scarce, respectively. Bald Eagles depend on nearshore marine communities for most of their prey in this ecosystem, so we predicted that the recent decline in otter populations would have an indirect negative effect on diets and demography of Bald Eagles. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effects on density of breeding pairs on four islands from 1993--1994 to 2000--2002. In contrast, diets and diet diversity of Bald Eagles changed considerably between the two time periods, likely reflecting a change in prey availability resulting from the increase and subsequent decline in sea otter populations. The frequency of sea otter pups, rock greenling (Hexagammus lagocephalus), and smooth lumpsuckers (Aptocyclus ventricosus) in the eagle's diet declined with corresponding increases in Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and various species of seabirds during the period of the recent otter population decline. Breeding success and productivity of Bald Eagles also increased during this time period, which may be due to the higher nutritional quality of avian prey consumed in later years. Our results provide further evidence of the wide-ranging indirect effects of sea otter predation on nearshore marine communities and another apex predator, the Bald Eagle. Although the indirect effects of sea otters are widely known, this example is unique because the food-web pathway transcended five species and several trophic levels in linking one apex predator to another.},

  abstract = {Ecological systems can undergo sudden, catastrophic changes known as critical transitions. Anticipating these critical transitions remains challenging in systems with many species because the associated early warning signals can be weakly present or even absent in some species, depending on the system dynamics. Therefore, our limited knowledge of ecological dynamics may suggest that it is hard to identify those species in the system that display early warning signals. Here, we show that, in mutualistic ecological systems, it is possible to identify species that early anticipate critical transitions by knowing only the system structure---that is, the network topology of plant--animal interactions. Specifically, we leverage the mathematical theory of structural observability of dynamical systems to identify a minimum set of ``sensor species,'' whose measurement guarantees that we can infer changes in the abundance of all other species. Importantly, such a minimum set of sensor species can be identified by using the system structure only. We analyzed the performance of such minimum sets of sensor species for detecting early warnings using a large dataset of empirical plant--pollinator and seed-dispersal networks. We found that species that are more likely to be sensors tend to anticipate earlier critical transitions than other species. Our results underscore how knowing the structure of multispecies systems can improve our ability to anticipate critical transitions.},

  abstract = {Assessing the functional role of species in a changing world is critical for effectively preserving ecosystems. Intuitively, this role should relate to how the loss of a species impacts a function. We develop a general approach to define the functional contribution of a species that interacts with others. Using experimental data from a ciliate microcosm experiment, we infer species dynamic contribution based on the observed functional impact of their removal. Using both model simulations and empirical data, we demonstrate that dynamic contributions are generically unrelated to their biomasses and traits associated with the function, but rather reflect a species' overall effect on others, and the level of functioning in the community without that species. Our novel characterization of the functional contribution of species reveals that, due to biotic interactions, rare species that do not possess unique functional traits are just as likely as any other species to be functionally important.},

  abstract = {Quantifying stability properties of ecosystems is an important problem in ecology. A common approach is based on the recovery from pulse perturbations, and posits that the faster an ecosystem return to its pre-perturbation state, the more stable it is. Theoretical studies often collapse the recovery dynamics into a single quantity: the long-term rate of return, called asymptotic resilience. However, empirical studies typically measure the recovery dynamics at much shorter time scales. In this paper we explain why asymptotic resilience is rarely representative of the short-term recovery. First, we show that, in contrast to asymptotic resilience, short-term return rates depend on features of the perturbation, in particular on the way its intensity is distributed over species. We argue that empirically relevant predictions can be obtained by considering the median response over a set of perturbations, for which we provide explicit formulas. Next, we show that the recovery dynamics are controlled through time by different species: abundant species tend to govern the short-term recovery, while rare species often dominate the long-term recovery. This shift from abundant to rare species typically causes short-term return rates to be unrelated to asymptotic resilience. We illustrate that asymptotic resilience can be determined by rare species that have almost no effect on the observable part of the recovery dynamics. Finally, we discuss how these findings can help to better connect empirical observations and theoretical predictions.},

Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, which makes comparisons across systems difficult to interpret. Here, we show how variability can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities. This requires that we abandon one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values generated by all possible stochastic perturbations. Despite this complexity, in species-rich systems, a generic pattern emerges from community assembly, relating variability to the abundance of perturbed species. Strikingly, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes to variability, driven by different types of perturbations, can lead to opposite diversity--stability patterns. We conclude that a multidimensional perspective on variability helps reveal the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

However, predicting the long-term transformations of communities following an invasion remains a challenging endeavour. We propose a general analytical method that uses both resident community and invader dynamical features to predict whether an invasion causes large long-term impacts on the invaded community. This approach reveals a direction in which classic invasion analysis, based on initial invasion growth rate, can be extended. Indeed, we explain how the density dependence of invasion growth, if properly defined, synthetically encodes the long-term biotic transformations caused by an invasion, and therefore predicts its ultimate outcome. This approach further clarifies how the density dependence of the invasion growth rate is as much a property of the invading population as it is one of the invaded community. Our theory applies to any stable community model, and directs us towards new questions that may enrich the toolset of invasion analysis, and suggests that indirect interactions and dynamical stability are key determinants of invasion outcomes.},

Yet, despite their importance, the term dominant species is poorly defined and often used to convey different information by different authors. Based on a review of historical and contemporary definitions we develop a synthetic definition of dominant species. This definition incorporates the relative local abundance of a species, its ubiquity across the landscape, and its impact on community and ecosystem properties. A meta-analysis of removal studies shows that the loss of species identified as dominant by authors can significantly impact ecosystem functioning and community structure. We recommend two metrics that can be used jointly to identify dominant species in a given community and provide a roadmap for future avenues of research on dominant species. In our review, we make the case that the identity and effects of dominant species on their environments are key to linking patterns of diversity to ecosystem function, including predicting impacts of species loss and other aspects of global change on ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The stability of complex ecological networks depends both on the interactions between species and the direct effects of the species on themselves. These self-effects are known as 'self-regulation' when an increase in a species' abundance decreases its per-capita growth rate. Sources of self-regulation include intraspecific interference, cannibalism, time-scale separation between consumers and their resources, spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear functional responses coupling predators with their prey. The influence of self-regulation on network stability is understudied and in addition, the empirical estimation of self-effects poses a formidable challenge. Here, we show that empirical food web structures cannot be stabilized unless the majority of species exhibit substantially strong self-regulation. We also derive an analytical formula predicting the effect of self-regulation on network stability with high accuracy and show that even for random networks, as well as networks with a cascade structure, stability requires negative self-effects for a large proportion of species. These results suggest that the aforementioned potential mechanisms of self-regulation are probably more important in contributing to the stability of observed ecological networks than was previously thought.},

However, our empirical knowledge of these networks is typically incomplete and the space of simulation models and parameters is vast, leaving room for uncertainty in theoretical predictions. Here we show that a large fraction of this space of possibilities exhibits generic behaviors that are robust to modeling choices. We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning, and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this ``disordered'' limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters. Our approach provides a powerful framework for predicting the outcomes of ecosystem assembly and quantifying the added value of more detailed models and measurements.},

Yet, ninety years into this theory, the conditions under which these patterns may occur and persist in nature remain subject to debate. Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for synthesis in a fragmented landscape of theoretical and empirical results. As a first step, we propose a minimal theory that combines the long-standing energetic and dynamical approaches of food chains. We chart theoretical predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: across various functioning and stability metrics, one regime is characterised by pyramidal patterns and the other by cascade patterns. The axes of this map combine key physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self-regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conflicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between various existing approaches to food chains, and between their predictions on functioning and stability, is a crucial step in confronting this theory to real ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The coexistence of many competing species in an ecological community is a long-standing theoretical and empirical puzzle. Classic approaches in ecology assume that species fitness and interactions in a given environment are mainly driven by a few essential species traits, and coexistence can be explained by trade-offs between these traits. The apparent diversity of species is then summarized by their positions (``ecological niches'') in a low-dimensional trait space. Yet, in a complex community, any particular set of traits and trade-offs is unlikely to encompass the full organization of the community. A diametrically opposite approach assumes that species interactions are disordered, i.e., essentially random, as might arise when many species traits combine in complex ways. This approach is appealing theoretically, and can lead to novel emergent phenomena, fundamentally different from the picture painted by low-dimensional theories. Nonetheless, fully disordered interactions are incompatible with many-species coexistence, and neither disorder nor its dynamical consequences have received direct empirical support so far. Here we ask what happens when random species interactions are minimally constrained by coexistence. We show theoretically that this leads to testable predictions. Species interactions remain highly disordered, yet with a ``diffuse'' statistical structure: interaction strengths are biased so that successful competitors subtly favor each other, and correlated so that competitors partition their impacts on other species. We provide strong empirical evidence for this pattern, in data from grassland biodiversity experiments that match our predictions quantitatively. This is a first-of-a-kind test of disorder on empirically measured interactions, and unique evidence that species interactions and coexistence emerge from an underlying high-dimensional space of ecological traits. Our findings provide a new null model for inferring interaction networks with minimal prior information and a set of empirical fingerprints that support a statistical physics-inspired approach of complex ecosystems.},

This deduction was at odds with both intuition and the observed complexity of many natural ecosystems. The so-called stability-diversity debate ensued, and the discussion about the factors contributing to ecosystem stability or instability continues to this day. We show in this work that dispersal can be a destabilising influence. To do this, we combine ideas from Alan Turing's work on pattern formation with May's random-matrix approach. We demonstrate how a stable equilibrium in a complex ecosystem with trophic structure can become unstable with the introduction of dispersal in space, and we discuss the factors which contribute to this effect. Our work highlights that adding more details to the model of May can give rise to more ways for an ecosystem to become unstable. Making May's simple model more realistic is therefore unlikely to entirely remove the upper bound on complexity.},

There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

However, networks are intrinsically limited to describing pairwise interactions, whereas real-world systems are often characterized by higher-order interactions involving groups of three or more units. Higher-order structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, are therefore a better tool to map the real organization of many social, biological and man-made systems. Here, we highlight recent evidence of collective behaviours induced by higher-order interactions, and we outline three key challenges for the physics of higher-order systems.},

  abstract = {We analyze perturbation experiments performed on real and ealized ecological communities. A community may be considered as a black box in the sense that the individual species grow and interact in complicated ways that are difficult to discern. Yet, by observing the response (output) of the system to natural or human---induced disturbances (inputs), information can be gained regarding the character and strengths of species interactions. We decline a perturbation as selective alteration of the density of one or more members of the community, and we distinguish two quite different kinds of perturbations. A PULSE perturbation is a relatively instantaneous alteration of species numbers, after which the system is studied as it 'relaxes' back to its previous equilibrium state. A PRESS perturbation is a sustained alteration of species densities (often a complete elimination of particular species): it is maintained until the unperturbed species reach a new equilibrium. The measure of interest in PRESS perturbation is the net change in densities of the unperturbed species. There is a very important difference between these two approaches: PULSE experiments yield information only on direct interactions (e.g. terms in the interaction matrix), while PRESS experiments yield information on direct interactions mixed together with the indirect effects mediated through other species in the community. We develop mathematical techniques that yield measures of ecological interaction between species from both types of experimental designs. Particular caution must be exercised in interpreting results form PRESS experiments, particularly when some species are lumped into functional categories and others are neglected altogether in the experimental design. We also suggest mathematical methods to deal with temporal and random variation during experiments. Finally, we critically review techniques that rely on natural variation in numbers to estimate species interaction coefficients. The problems with such studies are formidable.},

It is known, however, that even mild environmental noise may induce large fluctuations in population abundances. This is due to a resonance effect that occurs in communities on the edge of stability. Here, we use a simple predator-prey model to explore the sensitivity of plankton communities to stochastic environmental fluctuations. Our results show that the magnitude of resonance depends on the timescale of intrinsic population dynamics relative to the characteristic timescale of the environmental fluctuations. Predator-prey communities with an intrinsic tendency to oscillate at a period T are particularly responsive to red noise characterized by a timescale of . We compare these theoretical predictions with the timescales of temperature fluctuations measured in lakes and oceans. This reveals that plankton communities will be highly sensitive to natural temperature fluctuations. More specifically, we demonstrate that the relatively fast temperature fluctuations in shallow lakes fall largely within the range to which rotifers and cladocerans are most sensitive, while marine copepods and krill will tend to resonate more strongly with the slower temperature variability of the open ocean.},

Using a nonlinear bioenergetic population-dynamic model that accounts for temperature and body-mass dependencies of biological rates, we analysed the individual and interactive effects of increasing temperature and nutrient enrichment on the dynamics of a three-species food chain. At low temperatures, warming counteracts the destabilizing effects of enrichment by both bottom-up (via the carrying capacity) and top-down (via biological rates) mechanisms. Together with increasing consumer body masses, warming increases the system tolerance to fertilization. Simultaneously, warming increases the risk of starvation for large species in low-fertility systems. This effect can be counteracted by increased fertilization. In combination, therefore, two main drivers of global change and biodiversity loss can have positive and negative effects on food chain stability. Our model incorporates the most recent empirical data and may thus be used as the basis for more complex forecasting models incorporating food-web structure.},

Theory predicts that evolution can shape a system's tipping point behaviour, but direct experimental support is lacking. Here we investigate the power of evolutionary processes to alter these critical thresholds and protect an ecological community from collapse. To do this, we propagate a two-species microbial system composed of Escherichia coli and baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for over 4,000 generations, and map ecological stability before and after coevolution. Our results reveal that tipping points---and other geometric properties of ecological communities---can evolve to alter the range of conditions under which our microbial community can flourish. We develop a mathematical model to illustrate how evolutionary changes in parameters such as growth rate, carrying capacity and resistance to environmental change affect ecological resilience. Our study shows that adaptation of key species can shift an ecological community's tipping point, potentially promoting ecological stability or accelerating collapse.},

Confusion in global biodiversity trends thus remains, while assessing such changes is of major social, political, and scientific importance. Part of this variability may arise from the difficulty to reliably assess global biodiversity trends. Here, we conducted a literature review of studies documenting the temporal dynamics of global biodiversity. We classified the differences among approaches, data, and methodology used by the reviewed papers to reveal common findings and sources of discrepancies. We show that reviews and meta-analyses, along with the use of global indicators, are more likely to conclude that trends are declining. On the other hand, the longer the data are available, the more nuanced are the trends they generate. Our results also highlight the lack of studies providing information on the impact of synergistic pressures on a global scale, making it even more difficult to understand the driving factors of the observed changes and how to decide conservation plan accordingly. Finally, we stress the importance of taking into account the sources of confusion identified, as well as the complexity of biodiversity changes, in order to implement effective conservation strategies. In particular, biodiversity dynamics are almost systematically assumed to be linear, while non-linear trends are largely neglected. Clarifying the sources of confusion in global biodiversity trends should strengthen large-scale biodiversity monitoring and conservation.},

I consider three approaches of increasing sophistication: (1) dynamic management under a fixed model, (2) management that accounts for uncertainty over possible models, and (3) adaptive management that actively learns the correct model over the management process. This analysis confirms the prediction that long transients can create considerable uncertainty and give rise to very different optimal management policies, and also illustrates that dynamic management that can either plan for this uncertainty or actively learn to decrease the uncertainty can promote successful management of long transients.},

  abstract = {Trait-mediated interactions (TMIs), in which trophic and competitive interactions depend on individual traits as well as on overall population densities, have inspired large amounts of research, but theoretical and empirical studies have not been well connected. To help mitigate this problem, we review and synthesize the theoretical literature on TMIs and, in particular, on trait-mediated indirect interactions, TMIIs, in which the presence of one species mediates the interaction between a second and third species. (1) In models, TMIs tend to stabilize simple communities; adding further biological detail often reduces stability in models, but populations may persist even if their dynamics become mathematically unstable. (2) Short- and long-term changes in population density caused by TMIs depend even more on details, such as the curvature of functional responses and trade-offs, which have rarely been measured. (3) The effects of TMIs in multipredator communities depend in a straightforward way on the specificity of prey defenses. (4) Tritrophic and more complex communities are theoretically difficult; few general conclusions have emerged. Theory needs new kinds of experiments as a guide. The most critical needs are experiments that measure curvatures of trade-offs and responses, and experiments that (combined with theory) allow us to scale from short- to long-term responses of communities. Anecdotal evidence from long-term and large-scale studies suggests that TMIs may affect community dynamics at practical management scales; community models incorporating TMIs are necessary and require closer collaborations between theory and experiment.

  abstract = {Classic local stability theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist despite empiricists' abundant documentation of such complexity in nature. This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help fill this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populations' average body masses. Increasing predator--prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator--prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator--prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Natural communities form networks of species linked by interactions. Understanding the structure and dynamics of these ecological networks is pivotal to predicting species extinction risks, community stability and ecosystem functioning under global change. Traditionally, ecological network research has focused on interactions involving the flow of matter and energy, such as feeding or pollination. In nature, however, species also interact by intentionally or unintentionally exchanging information signals and cues that influence their behaviour and movement. Here we argue that this exchange of information between species constitutes an information network of nature---a crucial but largely neglected aspect of community organization. We propose to integrate information with matter flow interactions in multilayer networks. This integration reveals a novel classification of information links based on how the senders and receivers of information are embedded in food web motifs. We show that synthesizing information and matter flow interactions in multilayer networks can lead to shorter pathways connecting species and a denser aggregation of species in fewer modules. Ultimately, this tighter interconnectedness of species increases the risk of perturbation spread in natural communities, which undermines their stability. Understanding the information network of nature is thus crucial for predicting community dynamics in the era of global change.},

  abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

Understanding the effect of these processes on the community properties is central to ecology. Here we study these processes for a single community subject to migration from a pool of species, with population dynamics described by the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. We derive exact results for the phase diagram describing the dynamical behaviors, and for the diversity and species abundance distributions. A phase transition is found from a phase where a unique globally attractive fixed point exists to a phase where multiple dynamical attractors exist, leading to history-dependent community properties. The model is shown to possess a symmetry that also establishes a connection with other well-known models.},

Factors expected to boost resilience include prior exposure to the same disturbance and dispersal from undisturbed patches. Here we set up an in vitro system to test the effect of disturbance pre-exposure and dispersal represented by community mixing. We performed a serial passage experiment on a 23-species bacterial model community, varying pre-exposure history and dispersal rate between three metacommunity patches subjected to different levels of disturbance by the antibiotic streptomycin. As expected, pre-exposure caused evolution of resistance, which prevented decrease in species abundance. The more abundant the pre-exposed species had been in the undisturbed community, the less the entire community changed. Pre-exposure of the most dominant species also decreased abundance change in off-target species. In the absence of pre-exposure, increasing dispersal rates caused increasing spread of the disturbance across the metacommunity. However, pre-exposure kept the metacommunity close to the undisturbed state regardless of dispersal rate. Our findings demonstrate that pre-exposure is an important modifier of ecological resilience in a metacommunity setting.},

  abstract = {During the last decades, macroecology has identified broad-scale patterns of abundances and diversity of microbial communities and put forward some potential explanations for them. However, these advances are not paralleled by a full understanding of the dynamical processes behind them. In particular, abundance fluctuations of different species are found to be correlated, both across time and across communities in metagenomic samples. Reproducing such correlations through appropriate population models remains an open challenge. The present paper tackles this problem and points to sparse species interactions as a necessary mechanism to account for them. Specifically, we discuss several possibilities to include interactions in population models and recognize Lotka--Volterra constants as a successful ansatz. For this, we design a Bayesian inference algorithm to extract sets of interaction constants able to reproduce empirical probability distributions of pairwise correlations for diverse biomes. Importantly, the inferred models still reproduce well-known single-species macroecological patterns concerning abundance fluctuations across both species and communities. Endorsed by the agreement with the empirically observed phenomenology, our analyses provide insights into the properties of the networks of microbial interactions, revealing that sparsity is a crucial feature.},

We demonstrate that these resilience components are highly correlated with life history traits related to the species' pace of life and reproductive strategy. Species with longer generation times require longer recovery times post-disturbance, whilst those with greater reproductive capacity have greater resistance and compensation.

  abstract = {Natural communities commonly contain many different species and functional groups, and multiple types of species interactions act simultaneously, such as competition, predation, commensalism or mutualism. However, experimental and theoretical investigations have generally been limited by focusing on one type of interaction at a time or by a lack of a common methodological and conceptual approach to measure species interactions. We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions. These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an extinction-based model, a relative yield model and two generalized Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated. We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed for the specific methods and apply them to empirical data by experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispecies community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. The relative yield method is, in terms of final biomass production, the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely satisfied in ecological communities. We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict multispecies community dynamics across multiple functional groups. Our work unites available tools to measure species interactions under one framework. This improves our ability to make management-oriented predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem processes across study systems.},

  abstract = {The ongoing sixth mass species extinction is the result of the destruction of component populations leading to eventual extirpation of entire species. Populations and species extinctions have severe implications for society through the degradation of ecosystem services. Here we assess the extinction crisis from a different perspective. We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7\% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94\% of the populations of 77 mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear---extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity's crucial life-support systems from this existential threat.},

Location Drying river networks (DRN) in Europe. Time Period Present. Major Taxa Studied Aquatic macroinvertebrates. Methods We analyse the taxonomic and trait structure of 638 macroinvertebrate communities sampled across 125 reaches with perennial and intermittent streamflow, surveyed in six DRNs across Europe, up to six times over 1 year. Results Richness and trait diversity of macroinvertebrate communities decreased with increasing drying frequency, but increased with spatio-temporal connectivity in reaches with long drying events. Communities experiencing frequent drying events had higher relative abundance of taxa with a long lifecycle and drying resistance traits. Communities experiencing long drying events compensated by high spatio-temporal connectivity, and had more taxa with high fecundity and high dispersal ability. Taxa richness peaked in summer but that pattern was more prominent when drying frequency was high. Trait diversity decreased throughout the year, showing increasing abiotic stress as the year progressed. Communities changed from communities of mobile, fecund, short-lived taxa in spring and autumn to communities of long-lived taxa in summer. However, when drying frequency increased, autumn communities shifted towards communities of long-lived taxa. Macroinvertebrate community trait structure changed across Europe. It opposed communities from Mediterranean and/or upland DRNs (with more fecund and mobile taxa) to lowland DRNs (with more long-lived taxa). Main Conclusions Frequency and duration of drying events and spatio-temporal connectivity drive divergent macroinvertebrate community structures, suggesting the presence of an ecological threshold that explains the variability of disturbed ecosystems across broad spatial scales. These factors also influence seasonal variations, with macroinvertebrate communities shaped by distinct trait-filtering processes throughout the year based on drying frequency. Ultimately, spatio-temporal connectivity plays a crucial role in sustaining species richness and trait diversity in reaches experiencing intense drying.},

Past work on microbial coexistence has largely focused on species pairs, but it is unclear whether pairwise coexistence in isolation is required for coexistence in a multispecies community. To address this question, we conducted hundreds of pairwise competition experiments among the stably coexisting members of 12 different enrichment communities in vitro. To determine the outcomes of these experiments, we developed an automated image analysis pipeline to quantify species abundances. We found that competitive exclusion was the most common outcome, and it was strongly hierarchical and transitive. Because many species that coexist within a stable multispecies community fail to coexist in pairwise co-culture under identical conditions, we concluded that multispecies coexistence is an emergent phenomenon. This work highlights the importance of community context for understanding the origins of coexistence in complex ecosystems.},

In the present paper, we reviewed the mechanism and ecological importance of positive interactions in plant communities, emphasizing the certainties and uncertainties that have made it an attractive area of research.

  abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

This suggests that these motifs may reduce extinction risk for species participating in them, ultimately stabilising the food web as a whole. We test whether a species' time to extinction following a perturbation is related to its participation in stable and unstable motifs and assess how motif roles co-vary with a species' degree or trophic level. We found that species' motif roles are related to their times to extinction following a disturbance. Specifically, having a larger proportion of the motif role made up by the omnivory motif was associated with longer times to extinction, even though the omnivory motif is less stable than the others when modelled in isolation. While motif roles were associated with extinction risk, they also varied strongly with degree and trophic level. This means that these simpler measures of a species' role may be sufficient to roughly predict which species are most vulnerable to disturbance (though motif roles can be used to refine these predictions), but that studies of species' motif participation can also reasonably comment on vulnerability to extinction.},

  abstract = {1. The theta-logistic is a simple and flexible model for describing how the growth rate of a population slows as abundance increases. Starting at rm (taken as the maximum population growth rate), the growth response decreases in a convex or concave way (according to the shape parameter {\texttheta}) to zero when the population reaches carrying capacity. 2. We demonstrate that fitting this model to census data is not robust and explain why. The parameters {\texttheta} and rm are able to play-off against each other (providing a constant product), thus allowing both to adopt extreme and ecologically implausible values. 3. We use simulated data to examine: (i) a population fluctuating around a constant carrying capacity (K); (ii) recovery of a population from 10\% of carrying capacity; and (iii) a population subject to variation in K. We show that estimates of extinction risk depending on this or similar models are therefore prone to imprecision. We refute the claim that concave growth responses are shown to dominate in nature. 4. As the model can also be sensitive to temporal variation in carrying capacity, we argue that the assumption of a constant carrying capacity is both problematic and presents a fruitful direction for the development of phenomenological density-feedback models.},

  abstract = {Declines in global biodiversity have inspired a generation of studies that seek to characterize relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The metrics for complementarity and selection effects derived by Loreau and Hector in 2001 remain some of the most influential and widely used statistics for studying these relationships. These metrics quantify the degree to which the effect of biodiversity on a given ecosystem function depends on only a few species that perform well in monoculture and in mixture (the selection effect) or if the effect of biodiversity on a given ecosystem function is independent of monoculture performance (the complementarity effect). This distinction may be useful in determining the consequences of the loss of rare versus common or dominant species in natural systems. However, because these metrics require observations of all species in a community in monoculture, applications in natural systems have been limited. Here, we derive a statistical augmentation of the original partition, which can be applied to incomplete random samples of species drawn from a larger pool. This augmentation controls for the bias introduced by using only a subsample of species in monocultures rather than having monocultures of all species. Using simulated and empirical examples, we demonstrate the robustness of these metrics, and provide source code for calculating them. We find that these augmentations provide a reliable estimate of complementarity and selection effects as long as approximately 50\% of the species present in mixture are present in monoculture and these species represent a random subset of the mixture. We foresee two primary applications for this method: (a) estimating complementarity and selection effects for experimentally assembled communities where monoculture data are lacking for some species, and (b) extrapolating results from biodiversity experiments to diverse natural systems.},

Trophic interaction strengths are no exception, exhibiting scaling relationships with predator and prey traits that lack evolutionary explanations. We propose two rules to explain the scaling of trophic interaction strengths through the relationship between a predator's feeding rate and its prey's density---the so-called predator functional response. First, functional responses allow predators to meet their energetic demands when prey are rare. Second, functional responses approach their maxima near the highest prey densities predators experience. We show that equations derived from these rules predict functional response parameters across over 2100 functional response experiments and make additional predictions such as their allometric scaling. The two rules thereby offer a potential ultimate explanation for the determinants of trophic interaction strengths, revealing ecologically realised constraints to the complex, adaptive nature of functional response evolution.},

  abstract = {On San Juan Island, Washington, three species of intertidal barnacles (Balanus glandula, Balanus cariosus and Chthamalus fissus) are the main prey of several species of predators, the commonest being three species of snails, Thais emarginata, Thais canaliculata and Thais lamellosa. Larvae of B. glandula settle throughout the intertidal zone but, except in quiet bays, survive to maturity only in a narrow zone at the top of the shore. In quiet bays, where predators of barnacles were scarce, and in areas of turbulent water where predators were excluded by other circumstances, adult B. glandula occurred over the whole intertidal zone. From the lower part of the intertidal zone. Predators were evidently eliminating all B. glandula from the lower part of the intertidal zone. The rates of feeding of Thais lamellosa and Thais emarginata were measured in cages on the shore. The existing population of Thais could account for all of the mortality of B. glandula which occurred at low shore levels in mid and late summer. By late autumn these predators could eat all the remaining B. glandula of that year's settlement at low levels, but at upper shore levels the Thais population could not account for all the mortality of B. glandula in summer. The Thais populations shift upwards from the lower shore levels in the autumn and it is very probable that this increased predation is enough to eliminate the barnacles at the middle and upper shore within the next year. The recruitment of B. glandula every year was quite regular. The breeding population in the narrow 'refuge' zone at the top of the intertidal zone was capable of replacing itself as well as colonizing the middle and lower shore. The settlement below the refuge zone can be regarded simply as a regular food supply for the predator population. Because of the dependability of this food supply at upper shore levels, a predator, T. emarginata, has evolved to specialize at these upper levels. In Scotland, where the recruitment of barnacles is irregular, no such specialization is possible. Thus at least two species of predators are supported at different shore levels at San Juan Island, whereas only one species occupies the whole intertidal shore in Scotland. In Scotland, much of the mortality of young barnacles was caused by intraspecific crowding in dense populations, and these deaths provide food for scavengers, rather than predators. In contrast, at San Juan Island of the mortality of young barnacles is caused by predators. Thus the predators at San Juan Island are more efficient than those in Scotland, since they eat a much higher proportion of the available prey. Whereas in Scotland the distribution and abundance of barnacles is largely determined by competition for space, at San Juan Island the barnacles is largely determined by competition for space, at San Juan Island the barnacles are limited by predation.},

However, empirical evidence is lacking about which traits, or trade-offs, underlie species stability, especially across different biomes. We compiled a worldwide collection of long-term permanent vegetation records (greater than 7000 plots from 78 datasets) from a large range of habitats which we combined with existing trait databases. We tested whether the observed inter-annual variability in species abundance (coefficient of variation) was related to multiple individual traits. We found that populations with greater leaf dry matter content and seed mass were more stable over time. Despite the variability explained by these traits being low, their effect was consistent across different datasets. Other traits played a significant, albeit weaker, role in species stability, and the inclusion of multi-variate axes or phylogeny did not substantially modify nor improve predictions. These results provide empirical evidence and highlight the relevance of specific ecological trade-offs, i.e. in different resource-use and dispersal strategies, for plant populations stability across multiple biomes. Further research is, however, necessary to integrate and evaluate the role of other specific traits, often not available in databases, and intraspecific trait variability in modulating species stability.},

We also find that of all possible trait combinations, only 9\% are currently realized. Based on species' extinction probabilities, we predict this limited set of viable strategies will shrink further over the next 100 years, shifting the mammal and bird species pool towards small, fast-lived, highly fecund, insect-eating, generalists. In fact, our results show that this projected decline in ecological strategy diversity is much greater than if species were simply lost at random. Thus, halting the disproportionate loss of ecological strategies associated with highly threatened animals represents a key challenge for conservation.},

In the case of ecological communities under stress, the risk of approaching a tipping point is unknown, but its stakes are high. Here, we test recently developed critical slowing-down indicators as early-warning signals for detecting the proximity to a potential tipping point in structurally complex ecological communities. We use the structure of 79 empirical mutualistic networks to simulate a scenario of gradual environmental change that leads to an abrupt first extinction event followed by a sequence of species losses until the point of complete community collapse. We find that critical slowing-down indicators derived from time series of biomasses measured at the species and community level signal the proximity to the onset of community collapse. In particular, we identify specialist species as likely the best-indicator species for monitoring the proximity of a community to collapse. In addition, trends in slowing-down indicators are strongly correlated to the timing of species extinctions. This correlation offers a promising way for mapping species resilience and ranking species risk to extinction in a given community. Our findings pave the road for combining theory on tipping points with patterns of network structure that might prove useful for the management of a broad class of ecological networks under global environmental change.},

Indicators of resilience may help circumvent such limitation by signalling the proximity of ecological systems close to an abrupt transition. However, their successful application strongly depends on the ecosystem under question. Therefore, if we aim to use resilience indicators for ecological management in practice, we need to understand where and how they can be reliably monitored. Here, we test the performance of resilience indicators across species in simple modules of competition to help recognize best-indicator species in a community. We show that differences in species sensitivity to disturbances in a community is affected by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized system at equilibrium, We then use simulated time series to compare trends in variance and autocorrelation across species and at community level. We found high heterogeneity in the strength of the indicators across species, while community-based indicators scored better on average than indicators at species level. Looking at species features, we found that collapsing and invading species showed strongest trends, but we observed no relationship between the number of species interaction links and indicators. Lastly, we explored whether it is possible to identify best-indicator species based on their contribution to community variability using eigenvector decomposition methods Our results suggest that successfully identifying a best-indicator species for critical transitions in multispecies communities is not an easy task.},

Recently, it has been proposed that such loss of resilience may be detected from elevated autocorrelation and variance in the fluctuations of the state of an ecosystem due to critical slowing down; the underlying generic phenomenon that occurs at critical thresholds. Here we explore the robustness of autocorrelation and variance as indicators of imminent critical transitions. We show both analytically and in simulations that variance may sometimes decrease close to a transition. This can happen when environmental factors fluctuate stochastically and the ecosystem becomes less sensitive to these factors near the threshold, or when critical slowing down reduces the ecosystem's capacity to follow high-frequency fluctuations in the environment. In addition, when available data is limited, variance can be systematically underestimated due to the prevalence of low frequencies close to a transition. By contrast, autocorrelation always increases toward critical transitions in our analyses. To exemplify this point, we provide cases of rising autocorrelation and increasing or decreasing variance in time series prior to past climate transitions.},

However, these methods have limitations often underestimated when used in graphical modelling of ecological systems. In this opinion article, I examine the relationship between formal logic methods used to describe causal networks and their inherent statistical and epistemological limitations. I argue that while these methods offer valuable insights, they are restricted by axiomatic assumptions, statistical constraints and the incompleteness of our knowledge. To prove that, I first consider causal networks as formal systems, define causality and formalize their axioms in terms of modal logic and use ecological counterexamples to question the axioms. I also highlight the statistical limitations when using multivariate time-series analysis and Granger causality to develop ecological networks, including the potential for spurious correlations among other data characteristics. Finally, I draw upon G{\"o}del's incompleteness theorems to highlight the inherent limits of fully understanding complex networks as formal systems and conclude that causal ecological networks are subject to initial rules and data characteristics and, as any formal system, will never fully capture the intricate complexities of the systems they represent.

  abstract = {Global change constitutes a suite of major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. These threats can materialise via changes in the temporal stability of ecological communities and the services they provide. However, the majority of research on stability has focused on single trophic level communities and has not yet integrated classic theory about species richness and food web structure with more recent theory centred on response diversity and stochasticity. Using a stochastic bioenergenetic food-web model, we reveal that response diversity is a major driver of community stability. Moreover, positive stability-richness relationships emerge only in the presence of response diversity. In contrast to previous work, food-web structural properties are only secondary drivers of overall community stability, but interact with response diversity to determine the sign of the stability-richness relationship. Our study highlights the complex pathways by which food-web structure and response diversity drive community stability, and raises concerns about how the loss of response diversity may lead to a breakdown of stability and the capacity for these communities to deliver functions and services to human societies.},

  abstract = {Testing the extent to which ecological communities are structured by deterministic (niche-based) assembly processes, resulting in predictable species abundance and composition, is a fundamental goal of ecology. Here we use a 10-year dataset of 55,156 lianas comprising 86 species in an old-growth tropical forest in Panama to test whether community assembly is consistent with niche-based assembly processes. We find that species diversity and community composition was maintained because species conformed to four general requirements of coexistence theory: (1) species have negative conspecific frequency-dependent feedback that control their local population size; (2) species have a stronger negative effect on their own population than that of heterospecifics; (3) the equilibrium frequencies of species correspond to their relative abundance; and (4) species have positive invasibility. These results indicate that coexistence through deterministic niche-based processes controls local population sizes and prevents any one species from displacing others. Rare species persisted because particularly strong negative feedbacks maintained them at their relatively low equilibrium abundances, thus preventing them from going extinct. Furthermore, we show that it is necessary to use population demography to test coexistence theory because stem mortality alone does not reflect species demography. These findings have broad implications for species coexistence and diversity maintenance in tropical forests and possibly other ecosystems.},

The patterning consisted of the simultaneous occurrence of strong "top down" effects at lower trophic levels and strong "bottom up" effects at higher trophic levels. As the patterning resulted directly from the energetic organization of the food webs, the results show that energetics and community structure govern ecosystem stability by imposing stabilizing patterns of interaction strengths.},

  abstract = {Understanding the stability of ecological communities is a matter of increasing importance in the context of global environmental change. Yet it has proved to be a challenging task. Different metrics are used to assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios. Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological communities.},

Using high-resolution data from a six-year study following 12 independent plant--pollinator communities, we confirm that pollinator species with more persistent populations in the field are theoretically predicted to tolerate a larger range of environmental changes. Persistent communities are not necessarily more diverse, but are generally located in larger habitat patches, and present a distinctive combination of generalist and specialist species resulting in a more nested structure, as predicted by previous theoretical work. Hence, pollinator interactions directly inform about their ability to persist, opening the door to use theoretically informed models to predict species' fate within the ongoing global change.},

Even though a complete appreciation of the effects of perturbations on ecosystems requires the simultaneous measurement of these multiple components of stability, most ecological research has focused on one or a few of those components analysed in isolation. Here, we present a new view of ecological stability that recognises explicitly the non-independence of components of stability. This provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We illustrate the concept and approach using results from a field experiment, and show that the effective dimensionality of ecological stability is considerably lower than if the various components of stability were unrelated. However, strong perturbations can modify, and even decouple, relationships among individual components of stability. Thus, perturbations not only increase the dimensionality of stability but they can also alter the relationships among components of stability in different ways. Studies that focus on single forms of stability in isolation therefore risk underestimating significantly the potential of perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In contrast, application of the multidimensional stability framework that we propose gives a far richer understanding of how communities respond to perturbations.},

Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall `stability' of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientific and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that define many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

Alternatively, differences may arise from data sources: populations monitored individually, versus whole-assemblage monitoring. To test these hypotheses, we estimated population change metrics using assemblage data. For a set of 23 241 populations, 16 009 species, in 158 assemblages, we detected significantly accelerating extinction and colonisation rates, with both rates being approximately balanced. Most populations (85\%) did not show significant trends in abundance, and those that did were balanced between winners (8\%) and losers (7\%).

The presence of unfeasible interactions, termed forbidden links, due to physiological or morphological barriers, is likely to decrease the plasticity of interaction networks, affecting their robustness to species extinctions. However, the existence of these forbidden links has been long debated, stressing the need to learn more about their prevalence and putative consequences for community robustness to extinctions. To tackle this gap, we used a dataset of plant-hummingbird interactions collected in Brazil, Costa Rica and Ecuador along elevation gradients. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model, to assess the probabilistic importance of exploitation barriers in determining species interactions. We found evidence for exploitation barriers between flowers and hummingbirds with a shorter bill than the corolla. We also showed that the proportion of forbidden links can change drastically among communities, because of changes in trait distributions. Finally we showed that networks with a high proportion of forbidden links had low robustness, because of constraints on interaction rewiring. Our results suggest that exploitation barriers are not rare and strongly limit interaction rewiring, and thus the rescue of species experiencing partner extinction may be limited.},

The diversity of responses to environmental change among species contributing to the same ecosystem function, which we call response diversity, is critical to resilience. Response diversity is particularly important for ecosystem renewal and reorganization following change. Here we present examples of response diversity from both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and across temporal and spatial scales. Response diversity provides adaptive capacity in a world of complex systems, uncertainty, and human-dominated environments. We should pay special attention to response diversity when planning ecosystem management and restoration, since it may contribute considerably to the resilience of desired ecosystem states against disturbance, mismanagement, and degradation.},

In this book Elton introduced and drew together many principles still central to ecology today, including succession, niche, food webs, and the links between communities and ecosystems, each of which he illustrated with well-chosen examples. Many of Elton's ideas have proven remarkably prescient---for instance, his emphasis on the role climatic changes play in population fluctuations anticipated recent research in this area stimulated by concerns about global warming.  For Chicago's reprint of this classic work, ecologists Mathew A. Leibold and J. Timothy Wootton have provided new introductions to each chapter, placing Elton's ideas in historical and scientific context. They trace modern developments in each of the key themes Elton introduced, and provide references to the most current literature. The result will be an important work for ecologists interested in the roots of their discipline, for educated readers looking for a good overview of the field, and for historians of science.},

  abstract = {Plants often encounter unfavorable environmental conditions because of their sessile lifestyle. These adverse factors greatly affect the geographic distribution of plants, as well as their growth and productivity. Drought stress is one of the premier limitations to global agricultural production due to the complexity of the water-limiting environment and changing climate. Plants have evolved a series of mechanisms at the morphological, physiological, biochemical, cellular, and molecular levels to overcome water deficit or drought stress conditions. The drought resistance of plants can be divided into four basic types-drought avoidance, drought tolerance, drought escape, and drought recovery. Various drought-related traits, including root traits, leaf traits, osmotic adjustment capabilities, water potential, ABA content, and stability of the cell membrane, have been used as indicators to evaluate the drought resistance of plants. In the last decade, scientists have investigated the genetic and molecular mechanisms of drought resistance to enhance the drought resistance of various crops, and significant progress has been made with regard to drought avoidance and drought tolerance. With increasing knowledge to comprehensively decipher the complicated mechanisms of drought resistance in model plants, it still remains an enormous challenge to develop water-saving and drought-resistant crops to cope with the water shortage and increasing demand for food production in the future.},

  abstract = {1 Studies aiming to identify the prevalence and nature of density dependence in ecological populations have often used statistical analysis of ecological time-series of population counts. Such time-series are also being used increasingly to parameterize models that may be used in population management. 2 If time-series contain measurement errors, tests that rely on detecting a negative relationship between log population change and population size are biased and prone to spuriously detecting density dependence (Type I error). This is because the measurement error in density for a given year appears in the corresponding change in population density, with equal magnitude but opposite sign. 3 This effect introduces bias that may invalidate comparisons of ecological data with density-independent time-series. Unless census error can be accounted for, time-series may appear to show strongly density-dependent dynamics, even though the density-dependent signal may in reality be weak or absent. 4 We distinguish two forms of census error, both of which have serious consequences for detecting density dependence. 5 First, estimates of population density are based rarely on exact counts, but on samples. Hence there exists sampling error, with the level of error depending on the method employed and the number of replicates on which the population estimate is based. 6 Secondly, the group of organisms measured is often not a truly self-contained population, but part of a wider ecological population, defined in terms of location or behaviour. Consequently, the subpopulation studied may effectively be a sample of the population and spurious density dependence may be detected in the dynamics of a single subpopulation. In this case, density dependence is detected erroneously, even if numbers within the subpopulation are censused without sampling error. 7 In order to illustrate how process variation and measurement error may be distinguished we review data sets (counts of numbers of birds by single observers) for which both census error and long-term variance in population density can be estimated. 8 Tests for density dependence need to obviate the problem that measured population sizes are typically estimates rather than exact counts. It is possible that in some cases it may be possible to test for density dependence in the presence of unknown levels of census error, for example by uncovering nonlinearities in the density response. However, it seems likely that these may lack power compared with analyses that are able to explicitly include census error and we review some recently developed methods.},

The perspective of basically food or habitat limited populations is giving way to a more balanced perspective including varying levels of predation. The heavily descriptive, detailed methods of the traditional naturalist and the modern system analyst are being complimented with models of Hutchinsonian simplicity, where idealized, easily understandable models are offered as an approximation to reality. The analysis of Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin is presented as the major turning point in this revolution, where some key assumptions about trophic levels and population regulation are first used as a basis for analysis. Modeling by Rosenzweig put these assumptions on solid ground, and introduced a key variable, primary productivity. Fretwell and Oksanen and his colleagues generalized and extended the kind of logic used in these pioneering studies, to provide a theory that could be central to all of ecology. This theory is reviewed in the present study, is extended to include the field of community ecology, and arguments are offered defending the position that this research program, called Food Chain Dynamics, could be regarded as the central theory of ecology, at least as important as the theory of evolution.},

  abstract = {The logistic growth model is one of the most frequently used formalizations of density dependence affecting population growth, persistence and evolution. Ecological and evolutionary theory, and applications to understand population change over time often include this model. However, the assumptions and limitations of this popular model are often not well appreciated. Here, we briefly review past use of the logistic growth model and highlight limitations by deriving population growth models from underlying consumer--resource dynamics. We show that the logistic equation likely is not applicable to many biological systems. Rather, density-regulation functions are usually non-linear and may exhibit convex or concave curvatures depending on the biology of resources and consumers. In simple cases, the dynamics can be fully described by the Schoener model. More complex consumer dynamics show similarities to a Maynard Smith--Slatkin model. We show how population-level parameters, such as intrinsic rates of increase and equilibrium population densities are not independent, as often assumed. Rather, they are functions of the same underlying parameters. The commonly assumed positive relationship between equilibrium population density and competitive ability is typically invalid. We propose simple relationships between intrinsic rates of increase and equilibrium population densities that capture the essence of different consumer--resource systems. Relating population level models to underlying mechanisms allows us to discuss applications to evolutionary outcomes and how these models depend on environmental conditions, like temperature via metabolic scaling. Finally, we use time-series from microbial food chains to fit population growth models as a test case for our theoretical predictions. Our results show that density-regulation functions need to be chosen carefully as their shapes will depend on the study system's biology. Importantly, we provide a mechanistic understanding of relationships between model parameters, which has implications for theory and for formulating biologically sound and empirically testable predictions.},

The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the conditions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question: How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained?},

A vast literature has explored their respective ecological drivers, sometimes generating correlations between them. Here we instead reveal a fundamental connection: both pyramids and cascades reflect the dynamical sensitivity of the food chain to changes in species intrinsic rates. We deduce a direct relationship between cascades and pyramids, modulated by what we call trophic dissipation -- a synthetic concept that encodes the contribution of top-down propagation of consumer losses in the biomass pyramid. Predictable across-ecosystem patterns emerge when systems are in similar regimes of trophic dissipation. Data from 31 aquatic mesocosm experiments demonstrate how our approach can reveal the causal mechanisms linking trophic cascades and biomass distributions, thus providing a road map to deduce reliable predictions from empirical patterns.},

  abstract = {Most mammalian populations suffer from natural or human-induced disturbances; populations are no longer at the equilibrium (i.e., at stable [st]age distribution) and exhibit transient dynamics. From a literature survey, we studied patterns of transient dynamics for mammalian species spanning a large range of life-history tactics and population growth rates. For each population, we built an age-structured matrix and calculated six metrics of transient dynamics. After controlling for possible confounding effects of the phylogenetic relatedness among species using a phylogenetic principal component analysis and phylogenetic generalized least squares models, we found that short-term demographic responses of mammalian populations to disturbance are shaped by generation time and growth rate. Species with a slow pace of life (i.e., species with a late maturity, a low fecundity, and a long life span) displayed decreases in population size after a disturbance, whereas fast-living species increased in population size. The magnitude of short-term variation in population size increased with asymptotic population growth, being buffered in slow-growing species (i.e., species with a low population growth rate) but large in fast-growing species. By demonstrating direct links between transient dynamics, life history (generation time), and ecology (demographic regime), our comparative analysis of transient dynamics clearly improves our understanding of population dynamics in variable environments and has clear implications for future studies of the interplay between evolutionary and ecological dynamics. As most populations in the wild are not at equilibrium, we recommend that analyses of transient dynamics be performed when studying population dynamics in variable environments.},

We classified 517 pelagic species into five predator functional groups. Most of these follow three prey selection strategies: a guild following the allometric rule whereby larger predators eat larger prey and two guilds of specialists that prefer either smaller or larger prey than predicted by the allometric rule. Such coexistence of non-specialist and specialist guilds independent from taxa or body size points towards structural principles behind ecological complexity. We show that the pattern describes {$>$}90\% of observed linkages in 218 food webs in 18 aquatic ecosystems worldwide.

We discuss the ecological questions that each network type can address, how measurements from different types of network should be interpreted, and their relative advantages. Networks with nodes aggregated to functional groups are suitable when focusing on ecosystem-level processes and ecosystem functions. Species-level networks provide information about the assembly of ecological communities or about how abiotic and biotic drivers influence species persistence. Networks with potential links are particularly useful for understanding ecological redundancy or for long-term or large-scale studies, where all potential interactions are likely to be realized. Networks of realized interactions provide access to finer mechanisms of the interplay between abiotic and biotic factors in determining ecological interactions. Identifying the advantages and limitations of different interaction networks will aid methodological decision~making and increase the utility and applicability of ecological networks in biodiversity and conservation research programmes.},

  abstract = {The growth of complex populations, such as microbial communities, forests, and cities, occurs over vastly different spatial and temporal scales. Although research in different fields has developed detailed, system-specific models to understand each individual system, a unified analysis of different complex populations is lacking; such an analysis could deepen our understanding of each system and facilitate cross-pollination of tools and insights across fields. Here, we use a shared framework to analyze time-series data of the human gut microbiome, tropical forest, and urban employment. We demonstrate that a single, three-parameter model of stochastic population dynamics can reproduce the empirical distributions of population abundances and fluctuations in all three datasets. The three parameters characterizing a species measure its mean abundance, deterministic stability, and stochasticity. Our analysis reveals that, despite the vast differences in scale, all three systems occupy a similar region of parameter space when time is measured in generations. In other words, although the fluctuations observed in these systems may appear different, this difference is primarily due to the different physical timescales associated with each system. Further, we show that the distribution of temporal abundance fluctuations is described by just two parameters and derive a two-parameter functional form for abundance fluctuations to improve risk estimation and forecasting.},

  abstract = {Determining the factors that affect community stability is crucial to understanding the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of global warming. We investigated how four temperature components (that is, median, variability, trend and extremes) affected diversity--synchrony--stability relationships for 1,246 bird and 580 fish communities from temperate regions. We hypothesized a stabilizing effect on the community if the variation in species' response to changing median temperature decreases overall community synchrony (hypothesis H1) and if temperature extremes reduce interspecific synchrony at extreme abundances due to variation in species' thermal tolerance limits (hypothesis H2). We found support for H1 in fish and for H2 in bird communities. Here we showed that the abiotic components (that is, the median, variability, trend and extremes of temperature) had more indirect effects on community stability, predominantly by affecting the biotic components (that is, diversity, synchrony). Considering various temperature components' direct as well as indirect impacts on stability for terrestrial versus aquatic communities will improve our mechanistic understanding of biodiversity change in response to global climatic stressors.},

One of the most debated aspects of this approach is that so far studies have neglected the role of population abundances on stability. While species abundances are well studied and empirically accessible, studies on stability have so far failed to incorporate this information. Here we tackle this question by explicitly including population abundances in a random matrix framework. We derive an analytical formula that describes the spectrum of a large community matrix for arbitrary feasible species abundance distributions. The emerging picture is remarkably simple: while population abundances affect the rate to return to equilibrium after a perturbation, the stability of large ecosystems is uniquely determined by the interaction matrix. We confirm this result by showing that the likelihood of having a feasible and unstable solution in the Lotka-Volterra system of equations decreases exponentially with the number of species for stable interaction matrices.},

  abstract = {The role of intraspecific variability (IV) in shaping community dynamics and species coexistence has been intensively discussed over the past decade and modelling studies have played an important role in that respect. However, these studies often implicitly assume that IV can be represented by independent random draws around speciesspecific mean parameters. This major assumption has largely remained undiscussed, although a great part of observed IV is structured in space or time, in particular when environmental dimensions that influence individual performance are imperfectly characterised or unobserved in the field. To test the impact of this strong assumption on the outcome of community dynamics models, we designed a simulation experiment where we varied the level of knowledge of the environment in virtual communities, resulting in different relative importance of explained vs unexplained spatial individual variation in performance. We used a community dynamics simulator to generate communities where the unexplained individual variation is, or is not, added as an unstructured random noise. Communities simulated with unstructured IV never reached the community diversity and composition of those where all the variation was explained and structured (perfect knowledge model). This highlights that incorporating unstructured IV (i.e. a random noise) to account for unexplained (but structured) variation can lead to incorrect simulations of community dynamics. In addition, the effects of unstructured IV on community diversity and composition depended on the relative importance of structured vs unstructured IV, i.e. on the level of knowledge of the environment, which may partly explain the contrasting results of previous studies on the effect of IV on species coexistence. In particular, the effect of unstructured IV on community diversity was positive when the proportion of structured IV vs unstructured IV in the model was low, but negative when this proportion was high. This is because unstructured random noise can either limit the competitive exclusion of inferior competitors in low dimensions or destabilise tight niche partitioning in high dimension. Our study suggests that it is crucial to account for the sources and structure of observed IV in real communities to better understand its effect on community assembly and properly include it in community dynamics models.},

Theory and evidence suggest that the loss or decline of stress-intolerant species can be compensated for by the growth of other species. Compensatory dynamics are a long-term feature of community dynamics across a broad range of models, and they can have strong stabilizing effects at the community level. Coexistence theory indicates that distinct environmental responses are required for compensatory dynamics and deemphasizes competition. Compensatory dynamics have been detected under experimental conditions, but are not dominant in a metanalysis of field surveys. Recent progress has been made in quantitative methods that detect compensatory dynamics at different temporal scales. Appropriate null models are required to sharpen our understanding of compensatory dynamics in nature. An integrated theory of compensation and compensatory dynamics will improve our ability to understand when communities maintain sufficient response diversity to buffer the effects of environmental change and anthropogenic stress.},

The ability of ecological communities to recover after small perturbations of the species abundances (local asymptotic stability) has been well studied, whereas the likelihood of a community to persist when the conditions change (structural stability) has received much less attention. Our goal is to understand the effects of diversity, interaction strengths and ecological network structure on the volume of parameter space leading to feasible equilibria. We develop a geometrical framework to study the range of conditions necessary for feasible coexistence. We show that feasibility is determined by few quantities describing the interactions, yielding a nontrivial complexity--feasibility relationship. Analysing more than 100 empirical networks, we show that the range of coexistence conditions in mutualistic systems can be analytically predicted. Finally, we characterize the geometric shape of the feasibility domain, thereby identifying the direction of perturbations that are more likely to cause extinctions.},

  abstract = {1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories -- dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A `mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.},

Our aim is to derive a strategy that can help to dispel the existing "confusion of tongues" on the subject of "stability" and prevent its future recurrence. The strategy consists of three questions that should be kept in mind when communicating about stability properties. These three questions should overcome the three main sources of confusion in terminology. Firstly, which stability properties are being addressed in the stability statement? Our analysis shows that the general term "stability" is so ambiguous as to be useless. It can be replaced by the stability properties "staying essentially unchanged" (constancy), "returning to the reference state (or dynamic) after a temporary disturbance" (resilience), and "persistence through time of an ecological system" (persistence). Second, to what ecological situation does the statement refer? An ecological situation is defined by a set of features that, taken as a whole, determine the domain of validity of a stability statement. The six most important features form the "ecological checklist", which serves to classify ecological situations and thereby provides a system of coordinates for communication. The six points are: variable of interest, level of description, reference state, disturbance, spatial scale and temporal scale. Thirdly, is the statement anchored in the situation in question, or is there unacceptable generalisation by inferring "stability" of the whole system from a certain stability property in a certain ecological ecological situation? This question separates the scientifically valuable content of a statement from the desire for general statements which is often projected through stability statements.},

Anthropogenic perturbations alter communities, but how they change stability and the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is not clear. We examined temporal stability (invariability) in aboveground productivity in replicated 18-year time series of experimentally perturbed grassland plant communities. We found that disturbed annual-dominated communities were more stable than undisturbed perennial communities, coincident with increases in the stabilizing effect of mean--variance scaling. We also found that nitrogen-fertilized communities maintained stability despite losses in species richness, probably because of increased compensatory dynamics and increased dominance by particularly stable dominant species. Among our communities, slight variation in diversity was not the strongest mechanism driving differences in stability. Instead, our study suggests that decreases in individual species variabilities and increases in the relative abundance of stable dominant species may help maintain stability in the functioning of ecosystems confronted with eutrophication, disturbance, and other global changes.},

  abstract = {Conservation, restoration and land management are increasingly implemented at landscape scales1,2. However, because species interaction data are typically habitat- and/or guild-specific, exactly how those interactions connect habitats and affect the stability and function of communities at landscape scales remains poorly understood. We combine multi-guild species interaction data (plant--pollinator and three plant--herbivore--parasitoid communities, collected from landscapes with one, two or three habitats), a field experiment and a modelling approach to show that multi-habitat landscapes support higher species and interaction evenness, more complementary species interactions and more consistent robustness to species loss. These emergent network properties drive improved pollination success in landscapes with more habitats and are not explained by simply summing component habitat webs. Linking landscape composition, through community structure, to ecosystem function, highlights mechanisms by which several contiguous habitats can support landscape-scale ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {We conducted an analysis of global forest cover to reveal that 70\% of remaining forest is within 1 km of the forest's edge, subject to the degrading effects of fragmentation. A synthesis of fragmentation experiments spanning multiple biomes and scales, five continents, and 35 years demonstrates that habitat fragmentation reduces biodiversity by 13 to 75\% and impairs key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles. Effects are greatest in the smallest and most isolated fragments, and they magnify with the passage of time. These findings indicate an urgent need for conservation and restoration measures to improve landscape connectivity, which will reduce extinction rates and help maintain ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {A new concept is introduced to analyse species' regional distributions and to relate the pattern of distributions to niche relations. Several sets of data indicate that average local abundance is positively correlated with regional distribution, i.e. the fraction of patchily distributed population sites occupied by the species. This observation is not consistent with the assumptions of a model of regional distribution introduced by Levins. A corrected model is now presented, in which the probability of local extinction is a decreasing function of distribution, and a stochastic version of the new model is analysed. If stochastic variation in the rates of local extinction and/or colonization is sufficiently large, species tend to fall into two distinct types, termed the "core" and the "satellite" species. The former are regionally common and locally abundant, and relatively well spaced-out in niche space, while opposite attributes characterize satellite species. This dichotomy, if it exists, provides null hypotheses to test theories about community structure, and it may help to construct better structured theories. Testing the core-satellite hypothesis and its connection to the r-K theory and to Raunkiaer's "law of frequency" are discussed. ///

Such subsidy couplings between ecosystems have important landscape-scale implications because perturbations in one ecosystem may affect community structure and functioning in neighbouring ecosystems via increased/decreased subsidies. Here, we combine a general theoretical approach based on harvesting theory and a two-patch protist meta-ecosystem experiment to test the effect of regional perturbations on local community dynamics. We first characterized the relationship between the perturbation regime and local population demography on detritus production using a mathematical model. We then experimentally simulated a perturbation gradient affecting connected ecosystems simultaneously, thus altering cross-ecosystem subsidy exchanges. We demonstrate that the perturbation regime can interact with local population dynamics to trigger unexpected temporal variations in subsidy pulses from one ecosystem to another. High perturbation intensity initially led to the highest level of subsidy flows; however, the level of perturbation interacted with population dynamics to generate a crash in subsidy exchange over time. Both theoretical and experimental results show that a perturbation regime interacting with local community dynamics can induce a collapse in population levels for recipient ecosystems. These results call for integrative management of human-altered landscapes that takes into account regional dynamics of both species and resource flows.},

This study investigated the heterogeneity of such variability within a real community and its impact on population stability in the face of pesticide application, particularly focusing on density-dependence of the interaction effect. Using outdoor mesocosms with a freshwater community, we found considerable heterogeneity in density-dependent interaction variability among links in the same community. This variability mediated the stability of recipient populations, with negative density-dependent interaction variability stabilizing whereas positive density-dependence and density-independent interaction variability destabilizing populations. Unexpectedly, the mean interaction strength, which is typically considered crucial for stability, had no significant effect, suggesting that how organisms interact on average is insufficient to predict the ecological impacts of pesticides. Our findings emphasize the multifaceted role of interaction variability in predicting the ecological consequences of anthropogenic disturbances such as pesticide application.},

  abstract = {MOST environments are spatially subdivided, or patchy, and there has been much interest in the relationship between the dynamics of populations at the local and regional (metapopulation) scales1. Here we study mathematical models for host-parasitoid interactions, where in each generation specified fractions ({\textmu}N and {\textmu}p, respectively) of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in each patch move to adjacent patches; in most previous work, the movement is not localized but is to any other patch2. These simple and biologically sensible models with limited diffusive dispersal exhibit a remarkable range of dynamic behaviour: the density of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in a two-dimensional array of patches may exhibit complex patterns of spiral waves or spatially chaotic variation, they may show static 'crystal lattice' patterns, or they may become extinct. This range of behaviour is obtained with the local dynamics being deterministically unstable, with a constant host reproductive rate and no density dependence in the movement patterns. The dynamics depend on the host reproductive rate, and on the values of the parameters {\textmu}N and {\textmu}p. The results are relatively insensitive to the details of the interactions; we get essentially the same results from the mathematically-explicit Nicholon--Bailey model of host-parasitoid interactions, and from a very general 'cellular automaton' model in which only qualitative rules are specified. We conclude that local movement in a patchy environment can help otherwise unstable host and parasitoid populations to persist together, but that the deterministically generated spatial patterns in population density can be exceedingly complex (and sometimes indistinguishable from random environmental fluctuations).},

Recent work has defined classes of deterministic mechanisms that can lead to long transients. Given the ubiquity of stochasticity in ecological systems, a similar systematic treatment of transients that includes the influence of stochasticity is important. Stochasticity can of course promote the appearance of transient dynamics by preventing systems from settling permanently near their asymptotic state, but stochasticity also interacts with deterministic features to create qualitatively new dynamics. As such, stochasticity may shorten, extend or fundamentally change a system's transient dynamics. Here, we describe a general framework that is developing for understanding the range of possible outcomes when random processes impact the dynamics of ecological systems over realistic time scales. We emphasize that we can understand the ways in which stochasticity can either extend or reduce the lifetime of transients by studying the interactions between the stochastic and deterministic processes present, and we summarize both the current state of knowledge and avenues for future advances.},

We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near {$\frac{3}{4}$}. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems vary widely in their responses to biodiversity change, with some losing function dramatically while others are highly resilient. However, generalizations about how species- and community-level properties determine these divergent ecosystem responses have been elusive because potential sources of variation (e.g., trophic structure, compensation, functional trait diversity) are rarely evaluated in conjunction. Ecosystem vulnerability, or the likely change in ecosystem function following biodiversity change, is influenced by two types of species traits: response traits that determine species' individual sensitivities to environmental change, and effect traits that determine a species' contribution to ecosystem function. Here we extend the response-effect trait framework to quantify ecosystem vulnerability and show how trophic structure, within-trait variance, and among-trait covariance affect ecosystem vulnerability by linking extinction order and functional compensation. Using in silico trait-based simulations we found that ecosystem vulnerability increased when response and effect traits positively covaried, but this increase was attenuated by decreasing trait variance. Contrary to expectations, in these communities, both functional diversity and trophic structure increased ecosystem vulnerability. In contrast, ecosystem functions were resilient when response and effect traits covaried negatively, and variance had a positive effect on resiliency. Our results suggest that although biodiversity loss is often associated with decreases in ecosystem functions, such effects are conditional on trophic structure, and the variation within and covariation among response and effect traits. Taken together, these three factors can predict when ecosystems are poised to lose or gain function with ongoing biodiversity change.},

Yet, traditional assessments of ecological complexity typically focus on species-species interactions that mediate a particular function (e.g., pollination), overlooking both the synergistic effect that multiple functions might develop as well as the resulting species-function participation patterns that emerge in ecosystems that harbor multiple ecological functions. Here we propose a mathematical framework that integrates various types of biotic interactions observed between different species. Its application to recently collected data of an islet ecosystem---reporting 1537 interactions between 691 plants, animals and fungi across six different functions (pollination, herbivory, seed~dispersal, decomposition, nutrient uptake, and fungal pathogenicity)---unveils a non-random, nested structure in the way plant species participate across different functions. The framework further allows us to identify a ranking of species and functions, where woody shrubs and fungal decomposition emerge as keystone actors whose removal have a larger-than-random effect on secondary extinctions. The dual insight---from species and functional perspectives---offered by the framework opens the door to a richer quantification of ecosystem complexity and to better calibrate the influence of multifunctionality on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The composition of communities is strongly altered by anthropogenic manipulations of biogeochemical cycles, abiotic conditions, and trophic structure in all major ecosystems. Whereas the effects of species loss on ecosystem processes have received broad attention, the consequences of altered species dominance for emergent properties of communities and ecosystems are poorly investigated. Here we propose a framework guiding our understanding of how dominance affects species interactions within communities, processes within ecosystems, and dynamics on regional scales. Dominance (or the complementary term, evenness) reflects the distribution of traits in a community, which in turn affects the strength and sign of both intraspecifc and interspecific interactions. Consequently, dominance also mediates the effect of such interactions on species coexistence. We review the evidence for the fact that dominance directly affects ecosystem functions such as process rates via species identity (the dominant trait) and evenness (the frequency distribution of traits), and indirectly alters the relationship between process rates and species richness. Dominance also influences the temporal and spatial variability of aggregate community properties and compositional stability (invasibility). Finally, we propose that dominance affects regional species coexistence by altering metacommunity dynamics. Local dominance leads to high beta diversity, and rare species can persist because of source--sink dynamics, but anthropogenically induced environmental changes result in regional dominance and low beta diversity, reducing regional coexistence. Given the rapid anthropogenic alterations of dominance in many ecosystems and the strong implications of these changes, dominance should be considered explicitly in the analysis of consequences of altered biodiversity.},

Recent modelling and conceptual work suggests that stability is a multidimensional construct comprising different response aspects. Using two freshwater mesocosm experiments as case studies, we show how the response to single perturbations can be decomposed in different stability aspects (resistance, resilience, recovery, temporal stability) for both ecosystem functions and community composition. We find that extended community recovery is tightly connected to a nearly complete recovery of the function (biomass production), whereas systems with incomplete recovery of the species composition ranged widely in their biomass compared to controls. Moreover, recovery was most complete when either resistance or resilience was high, the latter associated with low temporal stability around the recovery trend. In summary, no single aspect of stability was sufficient to reflect the overall stability of the system.},

  abstract = {Most ecosystems are affected by anthropogenic or natural pulse disturbances, which alter the community composition and functioning for a limited period of time. Whether and how quickly communities recover from such pulses is central to our understanding of biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem organisation, but also to nature conservation and management. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 508 (semi-)natural field experiments globally distributed across marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We found recovery to be significant yet incomplete. At the end of the experiments, disturbed treatments resembled controls again when considering abundance (94\%), biomass (82\%), and univariate diversity measures (88\%). Most disturbed treatments did not further depart from control after the pulse, indicating that few studies showed novel trajectories induced by the pulse. Only multivariate community composition on average showed little recovery: disturbed species composition remained dissimilar to the control throughout most experiments. Still, when experiments revealed a higher compositional stability, they tended to also show higher functional stability. Recovery was more complete when systems had high resistance, whereas resilience and resistance were negatively correlated. The overall results were highly consistent across studies, but significant differences between ecosystems and organism groups appeared. Future research on disturbances should aim to understand these differences, but also fill obvious gaps in the empirical assessments for regions (especially the tropics), ecosystems and organisms. In summary, we provide general evidence that (semi-)natural communities can recover from pulse disturbances, but compositional aspects are more vulnerable to long-lasting effects of pulse disturbance than the emergent functions associated to them.},

  abstract = {It is argued that alternate prey species in the diet of a food-limited generalist predator should reduce each other's equilibrial abundances, whether or not they directly compete. Such indirect, interspecific interactions are labeled apparent competition. Two examples are discussed in which an observed pattern of habitat segregation was at first interpreted as evidence for direct competition, but later interpreted as apparent competition resulting from shared predation. In order to study the consequences of predator-mediated apparent competition in isolation from other complicating factors, a model community is analyzed in which there is no direct interspecific competition among the prey. An explicit necessary condition for prey species coexistence is derived for the case of one predator feeding on many prey species. This model community has several interesting properties: (1) Prey species with high relative values for a parameter ra are ``keystone'' species in the community; (2) prey species can be excluded from the community by ``diffuse'' apparent competition; (3) large changes in the niche breadth of the predator need not correspond to large changes in predator density; (4) the prey trophic level as a whole is regulated by the predator, yet each of its constituent species is regulated by both the predator and available resources; (5) increased productivity may either increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the number of species in the community; (6) a decrease in density-independent mortality may decrease species diversity. These conclusions seem to be robust to changes in the prey growth equations and to the incorporation of predator satiation. By contrast, adding prey refugia or predator switching to the model weakens these conclusions. If the predator can be satiated or switched, the elements aij comprising the community matrix may have signs opposite the long-term effect of j upon i. The effect of natural selection upon prey species coexistence is discussed. Unless ri, Ki, and ai are tightly coupled, natural selection within prey species i will tend to decrease the equilibrial abundance of species j.},

  abstract = {Many important issues in community ecology revolve around the interplay of competition and predation. Species that compete may also be locked in predator-prey interactions, a mixture of competition and predation known as "intraguild predation" (IGP). There is growing evidence for the importance of IGP in many natural communities, yet little formal ecological theory addresses this particular blend of interactions. In this article, we explore the consequences of incorporating IGP into standard models of exploitative competition and food chains (a general resource-consumer model, a Lotka-Volterra food chain model, and Schoener's exploitative competition model). Our theoretical analyses suggest a general criterion for coexistence in IGP systems: the intermediate species (the prey in intraguild predation) should be superior at exploitative competition for the shared resource, whereas the top species (the predator) should gain significantly from its consumption of the intermediate species. Along gradients in environmental productivity, coexistence is most likely at intermediate levels of productivity. Analyses of the models reveal the potential for alternative stable states in systems with IGP; these are particularly likely if the top predator gains little benefit from consuming the intermediate predator. We further show that IGP can lead to unstable population dynamics, even when all pairwise interactions are inherently stable and each species can increase when rare. Persistent, strong IGP raises a puzzle of species coexistence, particularly in productive environments. We conclude by comparing IGP with related community modules (i.e., food chains, exploitative competition, apparent competition) and discussing mechanisms that should foster coexistence in systems with strong IGP.}

  abstract = {In population ecology, there has been a fundamental controversy about the relative importance of competition-driven (density-dependent) population regulation vs. abiotic influences such as temperature and precipitation. The same issue arises at the community level; are population sizes driven primarily by changes in the abundances of cooccurring competitors (i.e., compensatory dynamics), or do most species have a common response to environmental factors? Competitive interactions have had a central place in ecological theory, dating back to Gleason, Volterra, Hutchison and MacArthur, and, more recently, Hubbell's influential unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. If competitive interactions are important in driving year-to-year fluctuations in abundance, then changes in the abundance of one species should generally be accompanied by compensatory changes in the abundances of others. Thus, one necessary consequence of strong compensatory forces is that, on average, species within communities will covary negatively. Here we use measures of community covariance to assess the prevalence of negative covariance in 41 natural communities comprising different taxa at a range of spatial scales. We found that species in natural communities tended to covary positively rather than negatively, the opposite of what would be expected if compensatory dynamics were important. These findings suggest that abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation are more important than competitive interactions in driving year-to-year fluctuations in species abundance within communities.},

Beyond high biodiversity, communities exhibit a range of complex dynamics that are difficult to explain under a unified framework.

As either the number of species or the strength of interactions increases, we show that microbial ecosystems transition between three distinct dynamical phases, from a stable equilibrium in which all species coexist to partial coexistence to emergence of persistent fluctuations in species abundances, in the order predicted by theory. Under fixed conditions, high biodiversity and fluctuations reinforce each other. Our results demonstrate predictable emergent patterns of diversity and dynamics in ecological communities.},

Our meta-analysis shows that 1) nutrient enrichment has a positive effect on phytoplankton and zooplankton, while fish presence has a positive effect on phytoplankton and a negative effect on zooplankton in the food chains; 2) nutrient enrichment has a positive effect on highly edible algae and small herbivores, but no effect on poorly edible algae, large herbivores and omnivorous zooplankton in the food webs. Planktivorous fish have a positive effect on highly edible algae and small herbivores, a negative effect on large herbivores and omnivorous zooplankton, and no effect on poorly edible algae. Our meta-analysis confirms that nutrient enrichment and planktivorous fish affect functional groups differentially within trophic levels, revealing important changes in the functioning of food webs. The analysis of fish effects shows the well-described trophic cascade in the food chain and reveals two trophic cascades in the food web: one transmitted by large herbivores that benefit highly edible phytoplankton, and one transmitted by omnivorous zooplankton that benefit small herbivores. Comparison between the responses of food webs and simple food chains also shows consistent biomass compensation between functional groups within trophic levels.},

  abstract = {1 A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2 Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: `traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host--parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host--parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3 Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4 Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5 We conclude by suggesting a number of `dead ends' and `fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.},

These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability.

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms responsible for stability and persistence of ecosystems is one of the greatest challenges in ecology. Robert May showed that, contrary to intuition, complex randomly built ecosystems are less likely to be stable than simpler ones. Few attempts have been tried to test May's prediction empirically, and we still ignore what is the actual complexity--stability relationship in natural ecosystems. Here we perform a stability analysis of 116 quantitative food webs sampled worldwide. We find that classic descriptors of complexity (species richness, connectance and interaction strength) are not associated with stability in empirical food webs. Further analysis reveals that a correlation between the effects of predators on prey and those of prey on predators, combined with a high frequency of weak interactions, stabilize food web dynamics relative to the random expectation. We conclude that empirical food webs have several non-random properties contributing to the absence of a complexity--stability relationship.},

Our understanding of their expected shape relies on the assumption of invariant steady-state conditions. However, most of the world's ecosystems experience disturbances that keep them far from such a steady state. Here, using the allometric scaling between population growth rate and body-size, we predict the response of size-abundance pyramids within a trophic guild to any combination of disturbance frequency and intensity affecting all species in a similar way. We show that disturbances narrow the base of size-abundance pyramids, lower their height and decrease total community biomass in a nonlinear way. An experimental test using microbial communities demonstrates that the model captures well the effect of disturbances on empirical pyramids. Overall, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally how disturbances that are not size-selective can nonetheless have disproportionate impacts on large species.},

We undertake an exhaustive search for structural resilience across all three-species ecological networks, under a generalized Lotka-Volterra modelling framework. Out of 20,000 possible network structures, approximately 2\% display structural resilience. The properties of these networks provide important insights into the mechanisms that could promote resilience in ecosystems, provide new theoretical avenues for qualitative modelling approaches and provide a foundation for identifying robust forms of ecological resilience in large, realistic ecological networks.},

We show that trophic coherence---a hitherto ignored feature of food webs that current structural models fail to reproduce---is a better statistical predictor of linear stability than size or complexity. Furthermore, we prove that a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will always be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model that, by correctly capturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their stability and other basic structural features. Most remarkably, our model shows that stability can increase with size and complexity. This suggests a key to May's paradox, and a range of opportunities and concerns for biodiversity conservation.},

When described as networks these exhibit few or no cycles, and associated matrices have small leading eigenvalues. It has been suggested that this architecture can confer advantages to the system as a whole, such as ``qualitative stability,'' but this observation does not in itself explain how a loopless structure might arise. We show here that the number of feedback loops in a network, as well as the eigenvalues of associated matrices, is determined by a structural property called trophic coherence, a measure of how neatly nodes fall into distinct levels. Our theory correctly classifies a variety of networks---including those derived from genes, metabolites, species, neurons, words, computers, and trading nations---into two distinct regimes of high and low feedback and provides a null model to gauge the significance of related magnitudes. Because trophic coherence suppresses feedback, whereas an absence of feedback alone does not lead to coherence, our work suggests that the reasons for ``looplessness'' in nature should be sought in coherence-inducing mechanisms.},

At the same time, Lotka-Volterra (LV) consumer-resource models are a frequently used tool to study many questions in community ecology, but their capacity to produce Eltonian pyramids has not been formally analysed. Here, I address this knowledge gap by investigating if and when LV food chain models give rise to Eltonian pyramids.

The character and timescales of invasion impacts provide important insights into ecosystem dynamics and management. Yet long-term studies of invasion impacts remain rare and often confound invasive species impacts with coincident environmental change. One way to address this challenge is to ask: what ecological changes over time since invasion are recapitulated in ecosystems that span a range of conditions, are located in different regions, and were invaded in different decades? We synthesize many-decade time series across seven ecosystems to resolve shared changes in seven key ecosystem features following invasion by zebra mussels and subsequent invasion by quagga mussels. These two congeners are among the most widespread invasive species that re-engineer and increasingly co-invade freshwater ecosystems. Seven polymictic shallow lakes with long-term data sets reveal remarkably similar trends, with the strongest ecosystem impacts occurring within 5--10~years of zebra mussel invasion. Surprisingly, plankton communities then exhibited a partial, significant recovery. This recovery was absent, and impacts of initial invasion amplified, in four lakes where quagga mussels outcompeted zebra mussels and more completely depleted phytoplankton. Thus, we show that the ecosystem impacts of invasive species can subside over time but amplify with serial introductions of competing, even closely similar, taxa.},

However, we know little about how climate change-induced alterations in biomass production affect plant species composition. To better understand how climate change will alter both individual plant species and community biomass, we manipulated atmospheric [CO2], air temperature, and precipitation in a constructed old-field ecosystem. Specifically, we compared the responses of dominant and subdominant species to our climatic treatments, and explored how changes in plant dominance patterns alter community evenness over 2 years. Our study resulted in four major findings: (1) all treatments, elevated [CO2], warming, and increased precipitation increased plant community biomass and the effects were additive rather than interactive, (2) plant species differed in their response to the treatments, resulting in shifts in the proportional biomass of individual species, which altered the plant community composition; however, the plant community response was largely driven by the positive precipitation response of Lespedeza, the most dominant species in the community, (3) precipitation explained most of the variation in plant community composition among treatments, and (4) changes in precipitation caused a shift in the dominant species proportional biomass that resulted in lower community evenness in the wet relative to dry treatments. Interestingly, compositional and evenness responses of the subdominant community to the treatments did not always follow the responses of the whole plant community. Our data suggest that changes in plant dominance patterns and community evenness are an important part of community responses to climatic change, and generally, that such compositional shifts can alter ecosystem biomass production and nutrient inputs.},

Thus, numerous indirect pathways in large, complex ecological communities could make forecasting the long-term outcomes of environmental changes challenging. However, a comprehensive understanding of ecological structures causing indeterminacy has not yet been reached. Here, using random matrix theory (RMT), we provide mathematical criteria determining whether network indeterminacy emerges across various ecological communities. Our analytical and simulation results show that indeterminacy intricately depends on the characteristics of species interaction. Specifically, contrary to conventional wisdom, network indeterminacy is unlikely to emerge in large competitive and mutualistic communities, while it is a common feature in top--down regulated food webs. Furthermore, we found that predictable and unpredictable perturbations can coexist in the same community and that indeterminate responses to environmental changes arise more frequently in networks where predator--prey relationships predominate than competitive and mutualistic ones. These findings highlight the importance of elucidating direct species relationships and analyzing them with an RMT perspective on two fronts: It aids in 1) determining whether the network's responses to environmental changes are ultimately indeterminate and 2) identifying the types of perturbations causing less predictable outcomes in a complex ecosystem. In addition, our framework should apply to the inverse problem of network identification, i.e., determining whether observed responses to sustained perturbations can reconstruct their proximate causalities, potentially impacting other fields such as microbial and medical sciences.},

Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions exhibit highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to food web structure. The occurrence of different types of interactions, relative to all possible links, was well predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the source and target species. In this community, competition for space and positive interactions related to habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species were by far the most abundant non-trophic interactions. If these patterns are corroborated in other ecosystems, they may suggest potentially important dynamic constraints on the combined architecture of trophic and non-trophic interactions.

We have, nonetheless, lacked both the data and the tools to more rigorously understand the patterning of multiple interaction types between species (i.e., ``multiplex networks''), as well as their consequences for community dynamics. Using network statistical modeling applied to a comprehensive ecological network, which includes trophic and diverse non-trophic links, we provide a first glimpse at what the full ``entangled bank'' of species looks like. The community exhibits clear multidimensional structure, which is taxonomically coherent and broadly predictable from species traits.

We review decades of work on the topic and examine how our understanding has progressed. We show that our understanding of stability has remained fragmented and is limited largely to simple or simplified systems. There has been a profusion of metrics proposed to quantify stability, of which only a handful are used commonly. Furthermore, studies typically quantify one to two metrics of stability at a time and in response to a single perturbation, with some of the main environmental pressures of today being the least studied. We argue that we need to build on the existing consensus and strong theoretical foundation of the stability concept to better understand its multidimensionality and the interdependencies between metrics, levels of organisation and types of perturbations. Only by doing so can we make progress in the quantification of stability in theory and in practice, and eventually build a more comprehensive understanding of how ecosystems will respond to ongoing environmental change.},

  abstract = {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},

In particular, ecologists aim to identify generalisable rules that explain which types of food webs are more or less robust to secondary extinctions. Food web structure, or the patterns formed by species and their interactions, has been extensively studied as a potential factor that influences robustness to species loss. We systematically reviewed 28 studies to identify the relationships between food web structure and robustness to species loss and how the conclusions depend on methodological differences. Contrary to popular belief and theory, we found relatively consistent, positive relationships between connectance and robustness, among other generalities. Yet, we also found that conflicting conclusions about structure-robustness relationships can be, in part, attributed to differences in the type of data that studies use, particularly studies that use empirical data versus those generated from theoretical models. This review points towards a need to standardise methodology to answer the open question of whether robustness and its relationship with food web structure and to provide applicable insights for managing complex systems.},

Ecological responses to those disturbances are determined by both the vulnerabilities of species and their interspecific interactions. Understanding how individual species contribute to the (in-)stability of an aggregated community property, or function, is fundamental to ecological management and conservation. Here, we present a framework to identify species contributions to stability based on their absolute and relative responses to disturbances. Using simulations, we show that these two dimensions enable identification of (de-)stabilizing species and reveal that competitive dominance determines the magnitude of both absolute and relative contributions to stability. Applying our framework to empirical data from a multi-site mesocosm experiment showed that species contributions varied among treatments, sites, and seasons. Despite this dependency on both biotic and abiotic contexts, species contributions were generally constrained by their relative dominance in undisturbed conditions. Rare species contributed positively to stability, while dominant species contributed negatively, indicating compensatory dynamics. Our framework offers an important step toward a more mechanistic understanding of ecological stability based on species performance.},

A step-change in our understanding of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship was enabled by explicit measurement of the additional functioning provided by biodiversity through comparing expected and observed yields in multi-species communities. However, we lack an equivalent measure for stability. Here, we quantify the net biodiversity effect on stability using model simulations and a microcosm experiment that exposed different phytoplankton species and their combinations to temperature increases and fluctuations. As an emergent property of communities, stability frequently exceeded the expected stability of the combined component species, leading to a net biodiversity effect on stability analogous to the effect on functioning. In our simulations, these effects depended on the strength of competitive interactions as well as species composition and their thermal niche. Experimentally, the stabilising effect of diversity was, however, non-linear, greatest for two-species combinations, and varied with both community composition and disturbance regime. Quantifying the net biodiversity effect on stability advances our mechanistic understanding of the biodiversity-stability relationship, and provides crucial information to support ecosystem management and conservation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {To infer the processes that gave rise to past speciation and extinction rates across taxa, space and time, we often formulate hypotheses in the form of stochastic diversification models and estimate their parameters from extant phylogenies using Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian inference. Unfortunately, however, likelihoods can easily become intractable, limiting our ability to consider more complicated diversification processes. Recently, it has been proposed that deep learning (DL) could be used in this case as a likelihood-free inference technique. Here, we explore this idea in more detail, with a particular focus on understanding the ideal network architecture and data representation for using DL in phylogenetic inference. We evaluate the performance of different neural network architectures (DNN, CNN, RNN, GNN) and phylogeny representations (summary statistics, Lineage Through Time or LTT, phylogeny encoding and phylogeny graph) for inferring rates of the Constant Rate Birth-Death (CRBD) and the Binary State Speciation and Extinction (BISSE) models. We find that deep learning methods can reach similar or even higher accuracy than Maximum Likelihood Estimation, provided that network architectures and phylogeny representations are appropriately tuned to the respective model. For example, for the CRBD model we find that CNNs and RNNs fed with LTTs outperform other combinations of network architecture and phylogeny representation, presumably because the LTT is a sufficient and therefore less redundant statistic for homogenous BD models. For the more complex BiSSE model, however, it was necessary to feed the network with both topology and tip states information to reach acceptable performance. Overall, our results suggest that deep learning provides a promising alternative for phylogenetic inference, but that data representation and architecture have strong effects on the inferential performance.},

Focusing solely on aggregate responses may obscure extinction risks for certain species owing to compensatory effects, emphasizing the need to understand the drivers of the response variability at the species level. Yet, these drivers remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal that despite the typical complexity of biotic interaction networks, species' responses follow a discernible pattern. Specifically, we demonstrate that the species whose population abundances are most reduced by biotic interactions---which are not always the rarest species---are those that exhibit the strongest responses to disturbances. This insight enables us to pinpoint sensitive species within communities without requiring precise information about biotic interactions. Our novel approach introduces avenues for future research aimed at identifying sensitive species and elucidating their impacts on entire communities.},

  abstract = {Species interactions play a crucial role in shaping biodiversity, species coexistence, population dynamics, community stability and ecosystem functioning. Our understanding of the role of the diversity of species interactions driving these species, community and ecosystem features is limited because current approaches often focus only on trophic interactions. This is why a new modelling framework that includes a greater diversity of interactions between species is crucially needed. We developed a modular, user-friendly, and extensible Julia package that delivers the core functionality of the bio-energetic food web model. Moreover, it embeds several ecological interaction types alongside the capacity to manipulate external drivers of ecological dynamics. These new features represent important processes known to influence biodiversity, coexistence, functioning and stability in natural communities. Specifically, they include: (a) an explicit multiple nutrient intake model for producers, (b) competition among producers, (c) temperature dependence implemented via the Boltzmann-Arhennius rule, and (d) the ability to model several non-trophic interactions including competition for space, plant facilitation, predator interference and refuge provisioning. The inclusion of the various features provides users with the ability to ask questions about multiple simultaneous processes and stressor impacts, and thus develop theory relevant to real world scenarios facing complex ecological communities in the Anthropocene. It will allow researchers to quantify the relative importance of different mechanisms to stability and functioning of complex communities. The package was build for theoreticians seeking to explore the effects of different types of species interactions on the dynamics of complex ecological communities, but also for empiricists seeking to confront their empirical findings with theoretical expectations. The package provides a straightforward framework to model explicitly complex ecological communities or provide tools to generate those communities from few parameters.},

In effect, SL captures a collective outcome of species interactions, organizing how individual species respond to disturbances. When applied to data from protist community experiments, SL accurately forecasts species responses to temperature changes.

However, progress in this important area of ecology has been hindered by differing viewpoints on CDD across subfields in ecology, lack of synthesis across CDD-related frameworks, and misunderstandings about how empirical measurements of local CDD fit within the context of broader ecological theories on community assembly and diversity maintenance. Here, we propose a conceptual synthesis of local-scale CDD and its causes, including species-specific antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. First, we compare and clarify different uses of CDD and related concepts across subfields within ecology. We suggest the use of local stabilizing/destabilizing CDD to refer to the scenario where local conspecific density effects are more negative/positive than heterospecific effects. Second, we discuss different mechanisms for local stabilizing and destabilizing CDD, how those mechanisms are interrelated, and how they cut across several fields of study within ecology. Third, we place local stabilizing/destabilizing CDD within the context of broader ecological theories and discuss implications and challenges related to scaling up the effects of local CDD on populations, communities, and metacommunities. The ultimate goal of this synthesis is to provide a conceptual roadmap for researchers studying local CDD and its implications for population and community dynamics.},

  abstract = {1 The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2 We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3 To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4 We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5 This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

  abstract = {More than 400 species of vascular plants, in 87 genera, are acholophyllous and heterotrophic, but not directly parasitic upon autotrophs. They are usually, but incorrectly, described as 'saprophytes'since they are in fact nourished by means of specialized mycorrhizal associations. Although distributed world-wide, they are most abundant and show the greatest species-richness in the Neotropics and Palaeotropical regions. Their aerial parts range in size from a few centimetres to extensive liane types up to 40 m long. With few exceptions, their habitats are dense moist forests in which there is a surface accumulation of leaf litter, often in situations which are too shaded for autotrophic growth. Although the achlorophyllous mycorrhizal mode of life has evolved independently many times and in widely disparate taxonomic groups, such plants show strong convergent evolution in particular adaptations to their peculiar mode of life. Most prominant amongst these are reductions in the size of seed and embryo, and the lack of differentiation of the embryo at maturity. The number of seeds produced by each flower is typically very large and the shape, structure and surface features of seeds involving adaptation for wind dispersal show remarkable parallels in many species. Specific adaptations for zoochory are rare but well developed in a small number of genera, some of which produce scents like fungal fruit bodies or floral parts which mimic fungal sporocarps. Vegetative parts are often even more conspicuously reduced. Most myco-heterotrophs are entirely subterranean for most of their lives and these stages exhibit adaptations consistent with a change in function from organs of absorption to organs of storage, shown by the almost universal loss of root hairs, decrease in surface area as exhibited in short cylindric`vermiform'and tuberous roots or, in extreme cases, the complete suppression of roots and the formation of a swollen tuber or rhizome. Increased width of the root cortex often accommodates mycorrhizal infection and stores of carbohydrates and other materials obtained from the fungal symbiont. Mycorrhizal infection is confined to the below-ground parts of the plants but may be found there in modified stems as well as in roots. In many genera, stems are exceptionally slender and thread-like and their vascular tissues are either reduced to a single narrow cylinder of bicollateral bundles or, minimally, to four or six narrow bundles in the cortex. Secondary thickening is poorly developed in all but a tiny minority of species, lignification being confined to annular or, rarely, a few scalariform xylem vessels. Phloem is present in very small amounts and then mainly as parenchyma with sieve tubes frequently recorded as narrow and possibly with abherent sieve plates. Leaves are typically reduced to widely spaced achlorophyllous scales on the inflorescence axis. Occasionally, they are present only on underground rhizomes or tubers. The vascular supply to the leaf-scales, normally reduced to a single trace, may be absent. Vestigial stomata are sometimes found on leaves and, in a few species which retain traces of chlorophyll, on shoots but, in most fully heterotrophic species, stomata are absent from aerial parts. Since their seeds are very small and contain minimal reserve carbohydrates, the germination of myco-heterotrophs in nature would appear to depend upon infection by an appropriate symbiotic fungus at an early stage. The nature of the carbohydrates transferred from the fungus to the plants has not been determined. Once acquired from The fungal partner, most plants store carbon in a variety of forms, the most common of which is starch, although other compounds including glucomannan, fructan and calcium oxalate art important in some specks. Asexual reproduction is frequently important with root tubers, tubercles and rhizomes providing the means of vegetative spread. Nonetheless, all the angiospermous species recorded to date also reproduce sexually. Floral structures show varying degrees of reduction concomitant with myco-heterotrophy. Inflorescences are typically small, often with a single terminal flower, and the floral parts often show extreme simplification, with the production of unilocular or, more rarely, bilocular and trilocular ovaries. In some of the most highly adapted species, there is reduction of integumentary layers surrounding each ovule from the normal bitegmic condition to unitegmic or, occasionally, ategmic. With the principal exception of the Monotropaceae, placentation is typically trimerous and parietal. Flowers normally appear to be cross-pollinated and are brightly coloured. nectiferous, occasionally scented, and can demonstrate extreme morphological adaptations which attract insects as in the production of lone caudate tepals or fungus-mimicking structures. Much is still to be learned about the adaptive features and especially about the physiology of these plants and of their early developmental stages during which the essential associations with fungi are established. Similarly, studies of the taxonomy and physiology of most of their fungal partners are still in their infancy. Contents Summary 171 I. Introduction 172 II.

  abstract = {Understanding how environmental fluctuations affect the stability of populations and communities is complex, for example, because direct effects of environmental variability on populations may be modified and propagated across communities by species interactions. One way to explore and further understand these complexities is via a factorial manipulation of community composition and environmental conditions. Using laboratory based aquatic microcosms we manipulated environmental fluctuation by creating two environments; one with variable light and one with constant light. Within these environments, community composition was manipulated by constructing communities from all possible combinations of three species that vary in their reliance on light for growth (an autotroph: a diatom completely reliant on light, a heterotroph: a Paramecium species not reliant on light, and a mixotroph: a Paramecium species somewhat reliant on light). Community composition was predicted to affect populations and communities by introducing and altering competitive interactions between species and affecting the degree of niche differentiation between species. We found that population stability was predominantly influenced by an interaction between community composition and environmental variability, whereby the effect of environmental variability synergistically combined with effects of community composition to reduce population stability. Covariance of populations was determined by an interaction between community composition and environmental variability, though this did not result from the effect of niche differentiation between species. Species interactions drove correlations between population biomass and the environment which otherwise did not exist. Our results demonstrate the complex and interrelated effects of abiotic and biotic factors on population and community stability, and suggest the need to consider aspects of community composition when predicting the impact of environmental fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Predicting the composition and diversity of communities is a central goal in ecology. While community assembly is considered hard to predict, laboratory microcosms often follow a simple assembly rule based on the outcome of pairwise competitions. This assembly rule predicts that a species that is excluded by another species in pairwise competition cannot survive in a multispecies community with that species. Despite the empirical success of this bottom--up prediction, its mechanistic origin has remained elusive. In this study, we elucidate how this simple pattern in community assembly can emerge from resource competition. Our geometric analysis of a consumer-resource model shows that trio community assembly is always predictable from pairwise outcomes when one species grows faster than another species on every resource. We also identify all possible trio assembly outcomes under three resources and find that only two outcomes violate the assembly rule. Simulations demonstrate that pairwise competitions accurately predict trio assembly with up to 100 resources and the assembly of larger communities containing up to twelve species. We then further demonstrate accurate quantitative prediction of community composition using the harmonic mean of pairwise fractions. Finally, we show that cross-feeding between species does not decrease assembly rule prediction accuracy. Our findings highlight that simple community assembly can emerge even in ecosystems with complex underlying dynamics.},

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

However, little is known about the evolution of community robustness and productivity along diversification processes in species-rich systems. We leverage the recent structural approach to coexistence together with adaptive dynamics to study such properties and their relationships in a general trait-based model of competition on a niche axis. We show that the effects of coevolution on coexistence are two-fold and contrasting depending on the time scale considered. In the short term, evolution of niche differentiation strengthens coexistence, while long-term diversification leads to niche packing and decreased robustness. Moreover, we find that coevolved communities tend to be on average more robust and more productive than non-evolutionary assemblages. We illustrate how our theoretical predictions echo in observed empirical patterns and the implications of our results for empiricists and applied ecologists. We suggest that some of our results such as the improved robustness of Evolutionarily Stable Communities could be tested experimentally in suitable model systems.},

Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer--resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

Some well-studied drivers of such transitions lead to predictable outcomes such as a turbid lake or a degraded landscape. Many ecosystems are, however, complex systems of many interacting species. While detecting upcoming transitions in such systems is challenging, predicting what comes after a critical transition is terra incognita altogether. The problem is that complex ecosystems may shift to many different, alternative states. Whether an impending transition has minor, positive or catastrophic effects is thus unclear. Some systems may, however, behave more predictably than others. The dynamics of mutualistic communities can be expected to be relatively simple, because delayed negative feedbacks leading to oscillatory or other complex dynamics are weak. Here, we address the question of whether this relative simplicity allows us to foresee a community's future state. As a case study, we use a model of a bipartite mutualistic network and show that a network's post-transition state is indicated by the way in which a system recovers from minor disturbances. Similar results obtained with a unipartite model of facilitation suggest that our results are of relevance to a wide range of mutualistic systems.},

Specifically, we show that pollinator populations may collapse suddenly once drivers of pollinator decline reach a critical point. A high connectance and/or nestedness of the mutualistic network increases the capacity of pollinator populations to persist under harsh conditions. However, once a tipping point is reached, pollinator populations collapse simultaneously. Recovering from this single community-wide collapse requires a relatively large improvement of conditions. These findings may have large implications for our view on the sustainability of pollinator communities and the services they provide.},

Linear approximations aligned well with non-linear responses in bottom-heavy webs, but were less consistent in top-heavy webs.

  abstract = {Biotic complexity, encompassing both competitive interactions within trophic levels and consumptive interactions among trophic levels, plays a fundamental role in maintaining ecosystem stability. While theory and experiments have established that plant diversity enhances ecosystem stability, the role of consumers in the diversity--stability relationships remains elusive. In a decade-long grassland biodiversity experiment, we investigated how heterotrophic consumers (e.g., insects and fungi) interact with plant diversity to affect the temporal stability of plant community biomass. Plant diversity loss reduces community stability due to increased synchronisation among species but enhances the population-level stability of the remaining plant species. Reducing trophic complexity via pesticide treatments does not directly affect either community- or population-level stability but further amplifies plant species synchronisation. Our findings demonstrate that the loss of arthropod or fungal consumers can destabilise plant communities by exacerbating synchronisation, underscoring the crucial role of trophic complexity in maintaining ecological stability.},

Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.},

Each view implies different spatiotemporal community patterns. Along spatial environmental gradients, the organismic view predicts that species turnover is discontinuous, with sharp boundaries between communities, while the individualistic view predicts gradual changes in species composition. Using a spatially explicit multispecies competition model, we show that organismic and individualistic forms of community organisation are two limiting cases along a continuum of outcomes. A high variance of competition strength leads to the emergence of organism-like communities due to the presence of alternative stable states, while weak and uniform interactions induce gradual changes in species composition. Dispersal can play a confounding role in these patterns. Our work highlights the critical importance of considering species interactions to understand and predict the responses of species and communities to environmental changes.},

  abstract = {The stability of ecological communities has a profound impact on humans, ranging from individual health influenced by the microbiome to ecosystem services provided by fisheries. A long-standing goal of ecology is the elucidation of the interplay between biodiversity and ecosystem stability, with some ecologists warning of instability due to loss of species diversity while others arguing that greater diversity will instead lead to instability. Here, by considering a minimal two-level ecosystem with multiple predator and prey species, we show that stability does not depend on absolute diversity but rather on diversity differences between levels. We found that increasing diversity in either level first destabilizes but then stabilizes the community (i.e., a reentrant stability transition). We therefore find that it is the diversity difference between levels that is the key to stability, with the least stable communities having similar diversities in different levels. An analytical stability criterion is derived, demonstrating quantitatively that the critical diversity difference is determined by the correlation between how one level affects another and how it is affected in turn. Our stability criterion also applies to consumer--resource models with other forms of interaction such as cross-feeding. Finally, we show that stability depends on diversity differences in ecosystems with three trophic levels. Our finding of a nonmonotonic dependence of stability on diversity provides a natural explanation for the variety of diversity-stability relationships reported in the literature, and emphasizes the significance of level structure in predicting complex community behaviors.},

  abstract = {A common tendency in the field of population ecology has been to overlook individual differences by treating populations as homogeneous units; conversely, in behavioral ecology the tendency has been to concentrate on how individual behavior is shaped by evolutionary forces, but not on how this behavior affects population dynamics. Adam Lomnicki and others aim to remedy this one-sidedness by showing that the overall dynamical behavior of populations must ultimately be understood in terms of the behavior of individuals. Professor Lomnicki's wide-ranging presentation of this approach includes simple mathematical models aimed at describing both the origin and consequences of individual variation among plants and animals. The author contends that further progress in population ecology will require taking into account individual differences other than sex, age, and taxonomic affiliation--unequal access to resources, for instance. Population ecologists who adopt this viewpoint may discover new answers to classical questions of population ecology. Partly because it uses a variety of examples from many taxonomic groups, this work will appeal not only to population ecologists but to ecologists in general.},

  abstract = {Microbial systems appear to exhibit a relatively high switching capacity of moving back and forth among few dominant communities (taxon memberships). While this switching behavior has been mainly attributed to random environmental factors, it remains unclear the extent to which internal community dynamics affect the switching capacity of microbial systems. Here, we integrate ecological theory and empirical data to demonstrate that structured community transitions increase the dependency of future communities on the current taxon membership, enhancing the switching capacity of microbial systems. Following a structuralist approach, we propose that each community is feasible within a unique domain in environmental parameter space. Then, structured transitions between any two communities can happen with probability proportional to the size of their feasibility domains and inversely proportional to their distance in environmental parameter space---which can be treated as a special case of the gravity model. We detect two broad classes of systems with structured transitions: one class where switching capacity is high across a wide range of community sizes and another class where switching capacity is high only inside a narrow size range. We corroborate our theory using temporal data of gut and oral microbiota (belonging to class 1) as well as vaginal and ocean microbiota (belonging to class 2). These results reveal that the topology of feasibility domains in environmental parameter space is a relevant property to understand the changing behavior of microbial systems. This knowledge can be potentially used to understand the relevant community size at which internal dynamics can be operating in microbial systems.},

The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial6,7,8,9,10,11,12 because two types of mechanism may operate in combination6,13,14,15. In the `selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the `complementarity effect', resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics16,17,18,19. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment4 reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

This hypothesis, however, is unrealistic because it ignores the forces that contribute to synchronization of population dynamics. Here we present a mechanistic neutral model that describes the dynamics of a community of equivalent species under the joint influence of density dependence, environmental forcing, and demographic stochasticity. We also introduce a new standardized measure of species synchrony in multispecies communities. We show that the per capita population growth rates of equivalent species are strongly synchronized, especially when endogenous population dynamics are cyclic or chaotic, while their long-term fluctuations in population sizes are desynchronized by ecological drift. We then generalize our model to nonneutral dynamics by incorporating temporal and nontemporal forms of niche differentiation. Niche differentiation consistently decreases the synchrony of species per capita population growth rates, while its effects on the synchrony of population sizes are more complex. Comparing the observed synchrony of species per capita population growth rates with that predicted by the neutral model potentially provides a simple test of deterministic asynchrony in a community.},

Finally, he turns his attention to the controversial issue of the evolution of entire ecosystems and their properties, laying the theoretical foundations for a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology.   \emph{From Populations to Ecosystems} points the way to a much-needed synthesis in ecology, one that offers a fuller understanding of ecosystem processes in the natural world.},

Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity--stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity--stability debate to a final resolution.},

  abstract = {Biological insurance theory predicts that, in a variable environment, aggregate ecosystem properties will vary less in more diverse communities because declines in the performance or abundance of some species or phenotypes will be offset, at least partly, by smoother declines or increases in others. During the past two decades, ecology has accumulated strong evidence for the stabilising effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. As biological insurance is reaching the stage of a mature theory, it is critical to revisit and clarify its conceptual foundations to guide future developments, applications and measurements. In this review, we first clarify the connections between the insurance and portfolio concepts that have been used in ecology and the economic concepts that inspired them. Doing so points to gaps and mismatches between ecology and economics that could be filled profitably by new theoretical developments and new management applications. Second, we discuss some fundamental issues in biological insurance theory that have remained unnoticed so far and that emerge from some of its recent applications. In particular, we draw a clear distinction between the two effects embedded in biological insurance theory, i.e. the effects of biodiversity on the mean and variability of ecosystem properties. This distinction allows explicit consideration of trade-offs between the mean and stability of ecosystem processes and services. We also review applications of biological insurance theory in ecosystem management. Finally, we provide a synthetic conceptual framework that unifies the various approaches across disciplines, and we suggest new ways in which biological insurance theory could be extended to address new issues in ecology and ecosystem management. Exciting future challenges include linking the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and stability, incorporating multiple functions and feedbacks, developing new approaches to partition biodiversity effects across scales, extending biological insurance theory to complex interaction networks, and developing new applications to biodiversity and ecosystem management.},

Using surveys of plant populations in alpine communities worldwide, we explore patterns of positive and negative associations among triads of species (modules) and their relationship to local biodiversity. Three modules, each incorporating both positive and negative associations, were overrepresented, thus acting as "network motifs." Furthermore, the overrepresentation of these network motifs is positively linked to species diversity globally. A theoretical model illustrates that these network motifs, based on competition between facilitated species or facilitation between inferior competitors, increase local persistence. Our findings suggest that the interplay of competition and facilitation is crucial for maintaining biodiversity.},

Enrichment of the system by supplying excess bacteria resulted in the extinction of P. aurelia. The perturbing effect of D. nasutum's time delay was counteracted by reducing the amount of bacterial food for Paramecium. In this system, prey became food---limited at their peak density, resulting in limit cycle oscillations of predator and prey at approximately constant amplitude. The medium used for these experiments lack physical inconsistencies that might act as barriers to movement and did not provide the prey with a superior dispersal ability.

In a large experimental volume, predators reduced the prey population to a low density but were unable to capture them all. In small experimental volumes, all the P. aurelia were captured. In large---volume experimental systems enriched with abundant bacterial food, Didinium also captured all the prey. Thus, a large arena and the limitation of the prey population by its food supply are necessary for stable interaction and assure the survival of both predator and prey. Damped population oscillations of predator and prey occurred in the absence of refuges for prey or of physical heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Biological invasions are a major threat to natural communities worldwide. While several species traits have been identified as important determinants of invasion success, a systematic exploration of the effects of invasions on native communities, and the role of species and community features on community robustness in the face of invasion is lacking. We present a theoretical approximation considering food web structure and species population dynamics to study the effects of invasions on complex food webs. We find that less complex (i.e., less connected) food webs are more resistant to invasions. Simulated invasions promote profound changes in several food web properties and stability measures, such as decreases in modularity and the number of food chains from basal to top species; and a decoupling of community- and population-level temporal variability. Additionally, species traits such as body size and diet breadth are strong determinants of invasion success across several trophic levels, with larger and more generalist species being more successful invaders in general. Our work complements species-centered invasion studies by adding a more holistic and systematic perspective to the study of invasions on species interaction networks.},

Moreover, the trophic coherence of a network, defined in terms of trophic levels, is related to properties such as cycle structure, stability and percolation. The standard definition of trophic levels, however, borrowed from ecology, suffers from drawbacks such as requiring basal nodes, which limit its applicability. Here we propose simple improved definitions of trophic levels and coherence that can be computed on any directed network. We demonstrate how the method can identify node function in examples including ecosystems, supply chain networks, gene expression and global language networks. We also explore how trophic levels and coherence relate to other topological properties, such as non-normality and cycle structure, and show that our method reveals the extent to which the edges in a directed network are aligned in a global direction.},

It has been hypothesized that population temporal stability could be driven by functional trade-offs in resource acquisition and growth rate strategies. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing a 13-year data set from a mown grassland community in a factorial experiment with fertilization and dominant removal as the main treatment effects. Population temporal stability, measured as a coefficient of variation of species' biomass over time, was related to plant traits covering different functional trade-offs. These included plant height, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area, seed mass, leaf {$\delta$}13C, and rooting depth. Three of the traits (LDMC, rooting depth, and leaf {$\delta$}13C) had significant relationships with population temporal stability, even after accounting for species' phylogenetic relatedness. Higher values of LDMC, the best predictor, were consistently associated with greater population temporal stability across all experimental conditions. This suggests a functional trade-off along the leaf economics spectrum, with more conservative, slow-growing species being more stable over time. Incorporating functional trade-offs into the assessment of population temporal dynamics will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that sustain the stability of ecosystems and species coexistence.},

  abstract = {Species coexistence is a complex, multifaceted problem. At an equilibrium, coexistence requires two conditions: stability under small perturbations; and feasibility, meaning all species abundances are positive. Which of these two conditions is more restrictive has been debated for many years, with many works focusing on statistical arguments for systems with many species. Within the framework of the Lotka-Volterra equations, we examine the geometry of the region of coexistence in the space of interaction strengths, for symmetric competitive interactions and any finite number of species. We consider what happens when starting at a point within the coexistence region, and changing the interaction strengths continuously until one of the two conditions breaks. We find that coexistence generically breaks through the loss of feasibility, as the abundance of one species reaches zero. An exception to this rule - where stability breaks before feasibility - happens only at isolated points, or more generally on a lower dimensional subset of the boundary. The reason behind this is that as a stability boundary is approached, some of the abundances generally diverge towards minus infinity, and so go extinct at some earlier point, breaking the feasibility condition first. These results define a new sense in which feasibility is a more restrictive condition than stability, and show that these two requirements are closely interrelated. We then show how our results affect the changes in the set of coexisting species when interaction strengths are changed: a system of coexisting species loses a species by its abundance continuously going to zero, and this new fixed point is unique. As parameters are further changed, multiple alternative equilibria may be found. Finally, we discuss the extent to which our results apply to asymmetric interactions.},

The aim of this study was to test how subordinate plant species influence the functioning of a species-rich semi-natural grasslands. A plant removal experiment was set-up in the mountain grasslands of the Jura Mountains (Switzerland) to test the impact of subordinate plant species on soil microbial communities and ecosystem functioning. The experiment included three treatments: removal of all subordinate species, partial biomass removal of dominant species, and a no biomass removal control. After 2 years of treatments, we determined soil microbial community (bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi) by T-RFLP analysis and measured litter decomposition, soil respiration, soil inorganic nitrogen (DIN) availability and throughout above-ground biomass production as measures of ecosystem function. The removal of subordinate plant species strongly affected bacterial and weakly influenced mycorrhizal fungi communities and decreased rates of plant litter decomposition, soil respiration and DIN availability with larger effects than the partial loss of dominant biomass. The removal of subordinate plant species did not modify plant community structure, but it did reduce total above-ground biomass production compared to the control plots. Collectively, our findings indicate that the loss of subordinate species can have significant consequences for soil microbial communities and ecosystem functions, suggesting that subordinate species are important drivers of ecosystem properties.},

  abstract = {According to the insurance hypothesis, more diverse plant communities are more likely to be resistant to drought. Whilst many experiments have been carried out to determine the effects of plant diversity on plant community insurance, the results are still contradictory. Here, we conducted a drought experiment where we tested whether the presence of subordinate species increases plant community insurance. In Swiss Jura grassland, we combined a removal experiment of subordinate species with a summer drought event using rainout shelters. Plant community composition was determined after the drought and based on biomass measurements; we estimated resistance, recovery and resilience of the plant community for each combination of treatments. Moreover, to assess drought impacts on water-use efficiency (WUE), we analysed carbon isotope ratios ({$\delta$}13C values) in plant leaves of two dominants and two subordinates collected at the end of the drought period. We showed that subordinate species are more resistant to drought and increased community resistance by enhancing their above-ground biomass production during the imposed drought. These patterns were associated with decreased competitiveness of dominant species whose biomass decreased during drought. Significant increase in {$\delta$}13C values in plant tissue under drought indicated a better WUE for the measured species. Interestingly, the WUE was significantly higher in plots where subordinates were removed. Recovery and resilience were not affected by the summer drought, but the absence of subordinates reduced overall above-ground biomass in both watered and drought plots. Synthesis. We demonstrated that, independent of plant diversity, the presence of drought-resistant subordinate species increases plant community insurance against drought and, hence, is important for the functioning of grassland ecosystems.},

This rewiring can significantly affect how ecosystems function. To better predict the future structure of ecological networks, assessing their ability to adapt to changes is crucial. Here, we introduce two concepts: `rewiring capacity' of a single species (the multidimensional trait space of all its potential interaction partners within a region) and `rewiring potential' of a local community (the total trait space covered by interaction partners of the species at the target trophic level locally). To quantify the rewiring capacity and potential, we apply existing methods for determining species' functional interaction niches in a novel way to assess species' and communities' ability to form new interactions and the functional resilience of interaction networks to global change. To illustrate the applicability of these concepts, we quantified the rewiring capacity and potential of interactions between 1002 flowering plant species and 318 hummingbird species across the Americas. The rewiring capacity and potential metrics offer a new way to understand and quantify network resilience, allowing us to map how ecological networks respond to global change.},

In a strictly unvarying (deterministic) environment, there is in general no limit to the degree of overlap, short of complete congruence. However, in a fluctuating (stochastic) environment, the average food sizes for species adjacent on the resource spectrum must differ by an amount roughly equal to the standard deviation in the food size taken by either individual species. This mathematical result emerges in a nonobvious yet robust way for environmental fluctuations whose variance relative to their mean ranges from around 0.01\% to around 30\%. In short, there is an effective limit to niche overlap in the real world, and this limit is insensitive to the degree of environmental fluctuation, unless it be very severe. Recent field work, particularly on bird guilds, seems in harmony with the model's conclusion.},

Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems played a key role in introducing nonlinear mathematical models and the study of deterministic chaos into ecology, a role chronicled in James Gleick's book Chaos. In the quarter century since its first publication, the book's message has grown in power. Nonlinear models are now at the center of ecological thinking, and current threats to biodiversity have made questions about the role of ecosystem complexity more crucial than ever.

Using three well-studied experimental systems---encompassing plants, protists, and algae with grazers---we show that this method predicts the results of unobserved experiments with high accuracy, while making no assumptions about the dynamics of the systems. These results demonstrate a fundamentally different way of building and quantifying experimental systems, requiring far fewer experiments than traditional study designs. By developing a scalable method for navigating large systems, this work provides an efficient approach to studying highly diverse experimental communities.},

In real systems, however, there have been few tests for 'paradox' behaviour, and the few results are equivocal9--12. We have now tested for paradox behaviour in populations of the freshwater zooplankter Daphnia and their algal prey. In lakes and ponds these populations show both stable and cyclic dynamics13,14 caused by the interaction between the populations. The cycles are not driven by external forces14,15, but do not seem to be of the paradox-of-enrichment type: their amplitude is small, their period (equal to a Daphnia generation) is short, and there is good evidence that they are caused by the developmental delay of Daphnia14,15. Stage-structured models of the Daphnia--algae interaction indicate that such single-generation 'time-lag' cycles occur in the progression of instability from stable equilibrium to paradox cycles6,7, and that this progression may be driven by increasing nutrient levels7. We show here, however, that enrichment does not lead to paradox cycles, either in field or experimental Daphnia--algae systems. We suggest that concomitant changes in the predator--prey interaction accompanying enrichment could account for the absence of paradox behaviour.},

The zooplankton Daphnia and its algal prey in lakes throughout the world illustrate the problem4,5,6. Experiments show that this system fits the theory's assumptions7,8,9, yet it is not destabilized by enrichment6. We have tested and rejected four of five proposed explanations10. Here, we investigate the fifth mechanism: inedible algae in nutrient-rich lakes suppress cycles by reducing nutrients available to edible algae. We found three novel results in nutrient-rich microcosms from which inedible algae were excluded. First, as predicted by theory, some Daphnia-edible algal systems now display large-amplitude predator-prey cycles. Second, in the same environment, other populations are stable, showing only small-amplitude demographic cycles. Stability is induced when Daphnia diverts energy from the immediate production of young. Third, the system exhibits coexisting attractors---a stable equilibrium and large-amplitude cycle. We describe a mechanism that flips the system between these two states.},

Here, we show that even very weakly interacting species with no discernible effect on ecological dynamics can contribute substantially to ecosystem stability. Further, the nature of this contribution depends on biotic context, and both the type and complexity of interspecific interactions in the community. By manipulating multitrophic aquatic microcosm communities experimentally, we found that the contributions of a bacteriophage parasite to overall system stability following a pulse perturbation were variously stabilizing, destabilizing and neutral, depending on the presence of competitor or predator species of its bacterial host. This was despite the phage itself having no detectable effect on the biomass or growth rates of its host. Our results demonstrate the pivotal importance of both weak and indirect interactions in moderating the stability of whole ecological networks, and have profound implications for our ability to predict the consequences of perturbations on ecosystems.},

Here, we show that widespread evidence for demographic buffering can be artefactual, resulting from natural relationships between the mean and variance of vital rates. Following statistical scaling, we find no significant tendency for plant life histories to be buffered demographically. Instead, some species are buffered, whereas others have labile life histories with higher temporal variation in their more important vital rates. We find phylogenetic signal in the strength and direction of variance--importance correlations, suggesting that clades of plants are prone to being either buffered or labile. Species with simple life histories are more likely to be demographically labile. Our results suggest important evolutionary nuances in how species deal with environmental fluctuations.},

This difference in behavior can be traced to a resonant amplification of demographic fluctuations which disappears only when the number of individuals is strictly infinite.

The available empirical evidence, including data from an experimental perturbation of successional old fields and data on the impact of environmental fluctuations on properties of grasslands in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem of Tanzania and Kenya, suggests that the hypothesis is true at the primary producer level.

Our central concept is the `instantaneous interaction', which captures the feedback between the current environmental state and organismal growth, generating spatiotemporal context-dependencies as organisms modify their environment over time and/or space. We use small microbial communities to illustrate how this framework can predict time-dependencies in a toxin degradation system, and relate time- and spatial-dependencies in crossfeeding communities. By re-centring the relationship between organisms and their environment, our framework predicts the variations in interactions wherever intrinsic, organism-driven environmental change dominates over external drivers.},

  abstract = {Resilience is broadly understood as the ability of an ecological system to resist and recover from perturbations acting on species abundances and on the system's structure. However, one of the main problems in assessing resilience is to understand the extent to which measures of recovery and resistance provide complementary information about a system. While recovery from abundance perturbations has a strong tradition under the analysis of dynamical stability, it is unclear whether this same formalism can be used to measure resistance to structural perturbations (e.g. perturbations to model parameters). Here, we provide a framework grounded on dynamical and structural stability in Lotka--Volterra systems to link recovery from small perturbations on species abundances (i.e. dynamical indicators) with resistance to parameter perturbations of any magnitude (i.e. structural indicators). We use theoretical and experimental multispecies systems to show that the faster the recovery from abundance perturbations, the higher the resistance to parameter perturbations. We first use theoretical systems to show that the return rate along the slowest direction after a small random abundance perturbation (what we call full recovery) is negatively correlated with the largest random parameter perturbation that a system can withstand before losing any species (what we call full resistance). We also show that the return rate along the second fastest direction after a small random abundance perturbation (what we call partial recovery) is negatively correlated with the largest random parameter perturbation that a system can withstand before at most one species survives (what we call partial resistance). Then, we use a dataset of experimental microbial systems to confirm our theoretical expectations and to demonstrate that full and partial components of resilience are complementary. Our findings reveal that we can obtain the same level of information about resilience by measuring either a dynamical (i.e. recovery) or a structural (i.e. resistance) indicator. Irrespective of the chosen indicator (dynamical or structural), our results show that we can obtain additional information by separating the indicator into its full and partial components. We believe these results can motivate new theoretical approaches and empirical analyses to increase our understanding about risk in ecological systems.},

Here we show that the specific combinations of interacting species that emerge from the ecological dynamics within regional species pools are not all equally likely to be seen; rather, they are among the most likely to persist under changing environments. First, we use niche-based competition matrices and Lotka-Volterra models to demonstrate that realized combinations of interacting species are more likely to persist under random parameter perturbations than the majority of potential combinations with the same number of species that could have been formed from the regional pool. We then corroborate our theoretical results using a 10-year observational study, recording 88 plant-herbivore communities across three different forest successional stages. By inferring and validating plant-mediated communities of competing herbivore species, we find that observed combinations of herbivores have an expected probability of species persistence higher than half of all potential combinations. Our findings open up the opportunity to establish a formal probabilistic and predictive understanding of the composition of ecological communities.},

Using several population dynamics models, we demonstrate that we can infer these rankings from time-series data to predict the order of species sensitivities. We find that the most sensitive species are not always the ones with the most rapidly changing or lowest abundance, which are typical criteria used to monitor populations. Finally, using two empirical time series, we show that sensitive species tend to be harder to forecast. Our results suggest that incorporating information on species interactions can improve how we manage communities out of equilibrium.},

However, current theory on responses to such pulse perturbations focuses on equilibrium points and we lack a unified framework that accommodates other common, but more complicated, types of population fluctuations such as transients and cycles. Here we introduce this framework by deriving metrics that quantify the minimum, typical, and maximum amplification of perturbed abundances under nonequilibrium population dynamics. By simulating models under several nonequilibrium scenarios, we demonstrate that these metrics accurately characterize the full range of amplification of perturbed abundances in the short and long terms. Notably, we show that perturbation amplification depends strongly on community state in the short term, but this state dependency vanishes in the long term. Overall, our framework enables stability analysis for model and natural communities that do not exhibit equilibrium dynamics.},

In ecology, predicting the regime of population fluctuations under unobserved levels of an environmental driver has remained an unsolved challenge with important implications for conservation and management. Here, we show that integrating time-series data and information on a putative driver into a Gaussian Process regression model for the system's dynamics allows us to predict dynamical regimes without the need to specify the equations of motion of the system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict fixed-point, cyclic, or chaotic dynamics under unseen levels of a control parameter for a range of simulated population dynamics models. For a model with an abrupt population collapse, we show that our approach goes beyond an early warning signal by characterizing the regime that follows the tipping point. We then apply our approach to data from an experimental microbial food web and from a lake planktonic food web. We find that we can reconstruct transitions away from chaos in the microbial food web and anticipate the dynamics of the oligotrophic regime in the planktonic food web. These results lay the groundwork for making rational decisions about preventing, or preparing for, regime shifts in natural ecosystems and other dynamical systems.},

Two types of noise are studied: environmental (Gaussian white) noise and state-dependent demographic noise. The dynamical mechanism responsible for both phenomena is a transition from one stable steady state to another driven by stochastic forcing, mediated by an unstable steady state. Exploiting a generic and effective two-dimensional reduced model for real-world mutualistic networks, we find that the average transient lifetime scales algebraically with the noise amplitude, for both environmental and demographic noise. We develop a physical understanding of the scaling laws through an analysis of the mean first passage time from one steady state to another. The phenomena of noise-induced collapse and recovery and the associated scaling laws have implications for managing high-dimensional ecological systems.},

  abstract = {To determine the patterns of occurrence and importance of indirect effects relative to direct effects in natural communities, I analyzed experimentally based studies from 23 rocky intertidal habitats. The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive relationships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously identified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these 'classic' types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference competition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed 'apparent predation' and 'indirect defense' were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35\%) and apparent competition (25\%) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8\%) was least common in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect effects accounted for {$^\circ$}40\% of the change in community structure resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24---61\%. The proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with web species richness, indicating that strong direct interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level of alteration of community structure regardless of the level of web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias toward manipulation of consumers over manipulation of basal species, some predator---initiated indirect effect types were scarce while some basal species---initiated types were common. While the frequency of exploitation competition may have been underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this effect should have been detected in many of the studies and reported; and the most intensively studied individual webs did not report frequencies differing much from the average. This analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of theory.},

Furthermore, there is increasing interest in making comparisons of stability values across sites, systems and taxonomic groups, often using comparative synthetic approaches, such as meta-analysis. However, these synthetic approaches often compare/contrast systems where measures of stability mean very different things to the taxa involved. Here, we present results from theoretical models and empirical data to illustrate how differences in growth rates among taxa influence four widely used metrics of ecological stability of species abundances responding to pulse perturbations: resilience, recovery, resistance and temporal stability. We refer to these classic growth-rate-dependent metrics as `realised' stability. We show that realised resilience and realised temporal stability vary as a function of organisms' growth rates; realised recovery depends on the relation between growth rate and sampling duration; and realised resistance depends on the relation between growth rate and sampling interval. To account for these influences, we introduce metrics intended to be more independent of growth rates, which we refer to as `intrinsic' stability. Intrinsic stability can be used to summarise the overall effects of a disturbance, separately from internal recovery processes -- thereby allowing more general comparisons of disturbances across organisms and contexts. We argue that joint consideration of both realised and intrinsic stability is important for future comparative studies.},

Here, using a multispecies dynamical model of ecological communities including various interaction types (e.g. competition for space, predator interference, recruitment facilitation in addition to feeding), we studied the role of the presence and the intensity of these interactions for species diversity, community functioning (biomass and production) and the relationship between diversity and functioning.Taken jointly, the diverse interactions have significant effects on species diversity, whose amplitude and sign depend on the type of interactions involved and their relative abundance. They however consistently increase the slope of the relationship between diversity and functioning, suggesting that species losses might have stronger effects on community functioning than expected when ignoring the diversity of interaction types and focusing on feeding interactions only.},

  abstract = {In complex ecosystems, the loss of certain species can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions and invasions. However, our understanding of the prevalence of these critical ``keystone'' species and the factors influencing their emergence remains limited. To address these questions, we experimentally assembled microcosms from 16 marine bacterial species and found that multiple extinctions and invasions were exceedingly rare upon removal of a species from the initial inoculation. This was true across eight different environments with either simple carbon sources (e.g., glucose) and more complex ones (e.g. glycogen). By employing a generalized Lotka-Volterra model, we could reproduce these results when interspecies interactions followed a hierarchical pattern, wherein species impacted strongly by one species were also more likely to experience strong impacts from others. Such a pattern naturally emerges due to observed variation in carrying capacities and growth rates. Furthermore, using both statistical inference and spent media experiments, we inferred interspecies interaction strengths and found them consistent with structured interactions. Our results suggest that the natural emergence of structured interactions may provide community resilience to extinctions.},

Moreover, the metaphor hints that the interactions may be complex to the point of being impossible to understand. All interactions can be visualized as ecological networks, in which species are linked together, either directly or indirectly through intermediate species. Ecological networks, although complex, have well defined patterns that both illuminate the ecological mechanisms underlying them and promise a better understanding of the relationship between complexity and ecological stability.},

Despite their widespread occurrence and impact, these events remain largely unpredictable. In searching for the causes for collapse and instability, theoretical investigations have so far been unable to determine quantitatively the influence of the structural features of the network formed by the interacting species. Here, we derive the condition for the stability of a mutualistic ecosystem as a constraint on the strength of the dynamical interactions between species and a topological invariant of the network: the k-core. Our solution predicts that when species located at the maximum k-core of the network go extinct, as a consequence of sufficiently weak interaction strengths, the system will reach the tipping point of its collapse. As a key variable involved in collapse phenomena, monitoring the k-core of the network may prove a powerful method to anticipate catastrophic events in the vast context that stretches from ecological and biological networks to finance.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the recent progress in understanding the properties of transient dynamics in complex ecological systems. Predicting long-term trends as well as sudden changes and regime shifts in ecosystems dynamics is a major issue for ecology as such changes often result in population collapse and extinctions. Analysis of population dynamics has traditionally been focused on their long-term, asymptotic behavior whilst largely disregarding the effect of transients. However, there is a growing understanding that in ecosystems the asymptotic behavior is rarely seen. A big new challenge for theoretical and empirical ecology is to understand the implications of long transients. It is believed that the identification of the corresponding mechanisms along with the knowledge of scaling laws of the transient's lifetime should substantially improve the quality of long-term forecasting and crisis anticipation. Although transient dynamics have received considerable attention in physical literature, research into ecological transients is in its infancy and systematic studies are lacking. This text aims to partially bridge this gap and facilitate further progress in quantitative analysis of long transients in ecology. By revisiting and critically examining a broad variety of mathematical models used in ecological applications as well as empirical facts, we reveal several main mechanisms leading to the emergence of long transients and hence lays the basis for a unifying theory.},

Microbial competition for these scarce resources can be alleviated insofar as the intensity of nutrient uptake and assimilation activities are distributed heterogeneously across organisms over periodic input cycles. Recent analysis of community transcriptional dynamics in the nitrogen-limited subtropical North Pacific gyre revealed evidence of temporal partitioning of nitrogen uptake and assimilation between eukaryotic phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic bacteria over day-night cycles. Here, we present results from a Lagrangian metatranscriptomic time series survey in the Sargasso Sea and demonstrate temporally partitioned phosphorus uptake in this phosphorus-limited environment. In the Sargasso, heterotrophic bacteria, eukaryotic phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria express genes for phosphorus assimilation during the morning, day, and dusk, respectively. These results support the generality of temporal niche partitioning as an emergent mechanism that can structure uptake of limiting nutrients and facilitate coexistence of diverse microbes in open ocean ecosystems.},

It also touches two obvious features of reality, namely time lags, which destabilize the interaction, and density dependence (for example, resource limitation) in the prey, which is stabilizing. General model (the Lotka-Voltema equations) is also discussed and a criterion for estimating its stabilizing effect is presented. The chapter discusses the relationship between learning and functional response, and indicates the importance of two features, developmental response and numerical response, of the interaction. The chapter examines other aspects, namely the consequences for stability arising from the response of the individual predator to changes in the density of its prey (or to changes in the densities of two or more prey).},

Two-species population models of an interacting consumer and resource collapse to one-species dynamics when recruitment to the resource population is unrelated to resource abundance, thereby weakening the coupling between consumer and resource4,5,6. We predict that, in nature, generalist consumers that feed on many species should similarly show one-species dynamics. We test this prediction using cyclic populations, in which it is easier to infer underlying mechanisms7, and which are widespread in nature8. Here we show that one-species cycles can be distinguished from consumer--resource cycles by their periods. We then analyse a large number of time series from cyclic populations in nature and show that almost all cycling, generalist consumers examined have periods that are consistent with one-species dynamics. Thus generalist consumers indeed behave as if they were one-species populations, and a one-species model is a valid representation for generalist population dynamics in many-species food webs.},

  abstract = {Resilience is a component of ecological stability; it is assessed as the rate at which perturbations to a stable ecological system decay. The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator--prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation.},

We show and explain mathematically that this patterning enhances stability, because it reduces maximum ``loop weight'' and thus reduces the amount of intraspecific interaction needed for matrix stability. The patterns are brought about by biomass pyramids, a feature common to most ecosystems. Incorporation of biomass pyramids in 104 food-web descriptions reveals that the low weight of the long loops stabilizes complex food webs. Loop-weight analysis could be a useful tool for exploring the structure and organization of complex communities.},

We illustrate how these matrices correspond to different ways of characterizing interaction strengths, how they permit insights regarding different types of press perturbations, and how these are related by a simple scaling relationship. Connections to additional interaction strength characterizations encapsulated by the Beta matrix, the Gamma matrix, and the Removal matrix are also discussed.

We assume that the predator searches randomly, at constant speed, for randomly distributed prey, but that whether it attacks a contacted prey will depend on the species of the prey, the species of the last meal, and the time since the last meal. We establish a formula for the expected time between meals on species 1, and take the functional response on species 1, the number of species 1 eaten per unit time by a single predator, to be the reciprocal of this. The general formulae are somewhat complicated, but if it is assumed that the probability of attack is independent of time, it is possible to obtain a fairly simple expression for functional response. This functional response is not necessarily stabilizing; it will be if there is a sufficiently strong (relative to the handling times) tendency for the predator to be more likely to attack a contacted prey if it is the species that was eaten last. (More detail is given at the end of the section Switching and Stability.) We then consider relative attack rates (still assuming that preference is independent of time since the last meal) first by taking the ratio of the two functional responses (for species 1 and species 2) and next by regarding the sequence of meals as a Markov chain. The answers are the same: the relative attack rate is a function only of relative density, and switching occurs provided only that the product of the probabilities of attacking the same species as last eaten is greater than the product of the probabilities of attacking the other species. It is possible to have switching and yet not have a stabilizing functional response.}

FUNDAMENTALS OF ECOLOGY was first published in 1953 and was the vehicle Odum used to educate a wide audience about ecological science. This Fifth Edition of FUNDAMENTALS OF ECOLOGY is co-authored by Odum's protege Gary Barrett and represents the last academic text Odum produced. The text retains its classic holistic approach to ecosystem science, but incorporates and integrates an evolutionary approach as well. In keeping with a greater temporal/spatial approach to ecology, new chapters in landscape ecology, regional ecology, and global ecology have been added building on the levels-of-organization hierarchy. Also, a final chapter entitled "Statistical Thinking for Students of Ecology" provides a quantitative synthesis to the field of statistics. Contemporary and engaging, this text brings clarity and specificity to the study of ecology in the twenty-first century.},

Multiple-stressor research is a rapidly expanding field of science that seeks to understand and ultimately predict the interactions between stressors. Reviews and meta-analyses of the primary scientific literature have largely been specific to either freshwater, marine or terrestrial ecology, or ecotoxicology. In this cross-disciplinary study, we review the state of knowledge within and among these disciplines to highlight commonality and division in multiple-stressor research. Our review goes beyond a description of previous research by using quantitative bibliometric analysis to identify the division between disciplines and link previously disconnected research communities. Towards a unified research framework, we discuss the shared goal of increased realism through both ecological and temporal complexity, with the overarching aim of improving predictive power. In a rapidly changing world, advancing our understanding of the cumulative ecological impacts of multiple stressors is critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Identifying and overcoming the barriers to interdisciplinary knowledge exchange is necessary in rising to this challenge. Division between ecosystem types and disciplines is largely a human creation. Species and stressors cross these borders and so should the scientists who study them.},

  abstract = {Global change encompasses many co-occurring anthropogenic stressors. Understanding the interactions between these multiple stressors, whether they be additive, antagonistic or synergistic, is critical for ecosystem managers when prioritizing which stressors to mitigate in the face of global change. While such interactions between stressors appear prevalent, it remains unclear if and how these interactions change over time, as the majority of multiple-stressor studies rarely span multiple generations of study organisms. Although meta-analyses have reported some intriguing temporal trends in stressor interactions, for example that synergism may take time to emerge, the mechanistic basis for such observations is unknown. In this study, by analysing data from an evolution experiment with the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus ( 35 generations and 31,320 observations), we show that adaptation to multiple stressors shifts stressor interactions towards synergism. We show that trade-offs, where populations cannot optimally perform multiple tasks (i.e. adapting to multiple stressors), generate this bias towards synergism. We also show that removal of stressors from evolved populations does not necessarily increase fitness and that there is variation in the evolutionary trajectories of populations that experienced the same stressor regimes. Our results highlight outstanding questions at the interface between evolution and global change biology, and illustrate the importance of considering rapid adaptation when managing or restoring ecosystems subjected to multiple stressors under global change.},

  abstract = {Human influences have created a world where all ecosystems are exposed to multiple stressors with diverse characteristics and impacts. Organizing this ever-expanding list of stressors presents the opportunity to derive general rules, to understand effects and to improve predictions. Assessing the similarity of anthropogenic stressors can be approached from different perspectives, which we synthesize here. Stressors can be compared by asking what they are (traits), why they are present (sources), where they occur (spatial overlap), when they occur (temporal overlap), how they affect organisms (mode of action) and who they affect (co-tolerance). Some concepts of stressor similarity are thus related to intrinsic features of the stressors themselves (e.g. sources and traits), while other concepts pertain to the similarity of the effects of stressors and are therefore dependent on the ecological scale at which the effects of stressors are measured (e.g. mode of action and co-tolerance). Viewing stressor similarity as a multi-faceted and scale-dependent concept will open new avenues for stressor classification, will enhance predictions of the combined effects of stressors and may even inform the management of novel or emerging stressors. Keypoints The anthropogenic stressors that are impacting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide can be physical (e.g. warming), chemical (e.g. pesticides) or biological (e.g. disease) in nature. We show that stressors can be compared by asking what they are, why they are present, where they occur, when they occur, how they affect organisms and who, or which organisms, they affect. Understanding the similarity of stressors requires interdisciplinary collaboration and will help us to manage species and habitats threatend by a growing number of stressors.},

Freshwater scientists have invested considerable resources in conducting factorial experiments to disentangle stressor interactions by testing their individual and combined effects. However, the diversity of stressors and systems studied has hindered previous syntheses of this body of research. To overcome this challenge, we used a novel machine learning framework to identify relevant studies from over 235,000 publications. Our synthesis resulted in a new dataset of 2396 multiple-stressor experiments in freshwater systems. By summarizing the methods used in these studies, quantifying trends in the popularity of the investigated stressors, and performing co-occurrence analysis, we produce the most comprehensive overview of this diverse field of research to date. We provide both a taxonomy grouping the 909 investigated stressors into 31 classes and an open-source and interactive version of the dataset (https://jamesaorr.shinyapps.io/freshwater-multiple-stressors/). Inspired by our results, we provide a framework to help clarify whether statistical interactions detected by factorial experiments align with stressor interactions of interest, and we outline general guidelines for the design of multiple-stressor experiments relevant to any system. We conclude by highlighting the research directions required to better understand freshwater ecosystems facing multiple stressors.},

  abstract = {All species have evolved in the presence of disturbance, and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Consequently, disturbances within the typical range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturbations within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physically based disturbance (for example, storm, volcanic eruption, and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their interactions. Dispersal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that describe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations, either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery, and appear to have entered new domains or ``ecological surprises.'' In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state. We argue that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthropogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common. Understanding these ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental management decisions of the 21st century.},

Data were grouped by ecosystems (fresh water, salt water, terrestrial, and wetland) and response categories (biogeochemistry, hydrography, mobile biota, sedentary fauna, and vascular plants). We observed a repeated pattern of trade-offs between resistance and resilience across analyses.

  abstract = {The hypothesis that ecosystems are nominally linear in their large-scale dynamic characteristics, and that linearization is achieved in evolution, is explored in four principal respects. (i) Ecosystems are well behaved due to mechanisms and organizational attributes which promote or reflect superposition: complexity and largeness, homeostasis, hierarchical structure, environmental rather than state causation of many discontinuities, linear frequency response, single free equilibrium, global stability, and single forced steady state. (ii) Ultimate restriction on ecosystem development by abiotic resources suggests linear donor control as a system-level metaorganization superimposed upon detailed, nonlinear mechanisms. (iii) Ecosystem behavior in the large can be viewed, because of the small amount of the physical world which is actually biotic, as local dynamics about the equilibrium, ground, or zero state. (iv) Ecosystems, rich in feedback interconnections, are linearized by feedback elements that may be linear, nonlinear, or stochastic, with increasing effect. Linearization is posed as an evolutionary design problem, with natural selection operating to rid ecosystems of undesirable nonlinear characteristics or nullify their effects. The linearization hypothesis is in no sense definitively framed at this point, but there appear to be enough reasonable considerations to qualify it for treatment by ecologists as a serious ecosystem theory.},

  abstract = {AbstractEarly warning signals (EWSs) have the potential to predict tipping points where catastrophic changes occur in ecological systems. However, EWSs are plagued by false negatives, leading to undetected catastrophes. One reason may be because EWSs do not occur equally for all species in a system, so whether and how strongly EWSs are detected depends on which species is being observed. Here, we illustrate how the strength of EWSs is determined by each species' relationship to properties of the noise, the system's response to that noise, and the occurrence of critical slowing down (the dynamical phenomenon that gives rise to EWSs). Using these relationships, we present general rules for maximizing EWS detection in ecological communities. We find that for two-species competitive and mutualistic systems, one should generally monitor the species experiencing smaller intraspecific effects to maximize EWS performance, while in consumer-resource systems, one should monitor the species imposing the smaller interspecific effects. These guidelines appear to hold for at least some larger communities as well. We close by extending the theoretical basis for our rules to systems with any number of species and more complex forms of noise. Our findings provide important guidance on how to monitor systems for EWSs to maximize detection of tipping points.},

  abstract = {Non-native invasive plants can greatly alter community and ecosystem properties, but efforts to predict which invasive species have the greatest impacts on these properties have been generally unsuccessful. An hypothesis that has considerable promise for predicting the effects of invasive non-native plant species is the mass ratio hypothesis (i.e. that dominant species exert the strongest effects). We tested this hypothesis using data from a four year removal experiment in which the presence of two dominant shrub species (one native and the other not), and subordinate plant species, were manipulated in factorial combinations over four years in a primary successional floodplain system. We measured the effects of these manipulations on the plant community, soil nutrient status and soil biota in different trophic levels of the soil food web. Our experiment showed that after four years, low-biomass non-native plant species exerted disproportionate belowground effects relative to their contribution to total biomass in the plant community, most notably by increasing soil C, soil microbial biomass, altering soil microbial community structure and increasing the abundance of microbial-feeding and predatory nematodes. Low-biomass, non-native plant species had distinct life history strategies and foliar traits (higher foliar N concentrations and higher leaf area per unit mass) compared with the two dominant shrub species (97\% of total plant mass). Our results have several implications for understanding species' effects in communities and on soil properties. First, high-biomass species do not necessarily exert the largest impacts on community or soil properties. Second, low-biomass, inconspicuous non-native species can influence community composition and have important trophic consequences belowground through effects on soil nutrient status or resource availability to soil biota. Our finding that low-biomass non-native species influence belowground community structure and soil properties more profoundly than dominant species demonstrates that the mass ratio hypothesis does not accurately predict the relative effects of different coexisting species on community- and ecosystem-level properties.},

  abstract = {Losses and gains in species diversity affect ecological stability1--7 and the sustainability of ecosystem functions and services8--13. Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience2,3,6,11,12,14. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood15. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability16, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality17,18, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components3. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information.},

However, if the fates of ecological systems are better predicted by past responses to in situ climatic variation through time, this current analytical paradigm may be severely misleading. Empirically testing whether spatial or temporal climate responses better predict how species respond to climate change has been elusive, largely due to restrictive data requirements. Here, we leverage a newly collected network of ponderosa pine tree-ring time series to test whether statistically inferred responses to spatial versus temporal climatic variation better predict how trees have responded to recent climate change. When compared to observed tree growth responses to climate change since 1980, predictions derived from spatial climatic variation were wrong in both magnitude and direction. This was not the case for predictions derived from climatic variation through time, which were able to replicate observed responses well. Future climate scenarios through the end of the 21st century exacerbated these disparities. These results suggest that the currently dominant paradigm of forecasting the ecological impacts of climate change based on spatial climatic variation may be severely misleading over decadal to centennial timescales.},

Microcosms permit experimental control over species composition and rates of environmental change. Here we show using microcosm experiments that extinction risk in warming environments depends on trophic position but remains unaffected by biodiversity. Warmed communities disproportionately lose top predators and herbivores, and become increasingly dominated by autotrophs and bacterivores. Changes in the relative distribution of organisms among trophically defined functional groups lead to differences in ecosystem function beyond those expected from temperature-dependent physiological rates. Diverse communities retain more species than depauperate ones, as predicted by the insurance hypothesis, which suggests that high biodiversity buffers against the effects of environmental variation because tolerant species are more likely to be found6,7. Studies of single trophic levels clearly show that warming can affect the distribution and abundance of species2,4,5, but complex responses generated in entire food webs greatly complicate inferences based on single functional groups.},

This measure of functional diversity ``FD'' is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

Though widely used, we argue that the gLV model should be avoided for estimating interactions in batch culture --- the most common, simplest and cheapest in vitro approach to culturing microbes. Fortunately, alternative approaches offer a way out of this conundrum. Firstly, on the experimental side, alternatives such as the serial-transfer and chemostat systems more closely match the theoretical assumptions of the gLV model. Secondly, on the theoretical side, explicit organism-environment interaction models can be used to study the dynamics of batch-culture systems.

Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled.

The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional, heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer networks based on a review of previous, related approaches; illustrate their application and potential with analyses of existing data; and discuss limitations, challenges, and future applications.

In this note we attack the problem of omnivory using simple, linear Lotka--Volterra models of food webs9, and show that certain patterns are much more likely to persist on an evolutionary time scale than others. We then compare the model predictions with real food webs.},

We assess key statistics about species, their distribution, and their status. Most are undescribed. Those we know best have large geographical ranges and are often common within them. Most known species have small ranges. The numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly, even in well-known taxa. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. Current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the likely background rate of extinction. Future rates depend on many factors and are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity.}

Ecological interactions form complex networks with multiple direct and indirect paths through which the impacts of an extinction may propagate. Here we show that accounting for these multiple paths connecting species is necessary to predict how extinctions affect the integrity of ecological networks. Using an approach initially developed for the study of information flow, we estimate indirect effects in plant--pollinator networks and find that even those species with several direct interactions may have much of their influence over others through long indirect paths. Next, we perform extinction simulations in those networks and show that although traditional connectivity metrics fail in the prediction of coextinction patterns, accounting for indirect interaction paths allows predicting species' vulnerability to the cascading effects of an extinction event. Embracing the structural complexity of ecological systems contributes towards a more predictive ecology, which is of paramount importance amid the current biodiversity crisis.},

Here, we evaluated the single and combined effects of common agricultural stressors (insecticide, herbicide and nutrients) on four dimensions of stability (resistance, resilience, recovery and invariability) and on the overall dimensionality of stability (DS) using the results of a freshwater mesocosm experiment. Functional recovery and resilience to pesticides were enhanced in nutrient-enriched systems, whereas compositional recovery was generally not achieved. Pesticides did not affect compositional DS, whereas functional DS was significantly increased by the insecticide only in non-enriched systems. Stressor interactions acted non-additively on single stability dimensions as well as on functional DS. Moreover we demonstrate that pesticides can modify the correlation between functional and compositional aspects of stability. Our study shows that different disturbance types, and their interactions, require specific management actions to promote ecosystem stability.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms underlying ecosystem stability is crucial in predicting ecological responses to environmental fluctuations. While the diversity-stability relationship has been widely studied, the role of species' fundamental responses to the environment remains underexplored. Here, we investigate how the distribution of fundamental responses, captured by a novel metric---imbalance---drives ecosystem stability through asynchrony and population stability. Using a microcosm experiment with protist communities, we manipulated species richness and response distributions (defined as interspecific variation in species performance curves) under fluctuating temperature and different nutrient concentrations. Our results show that lower imbalance, achieved through asynchrony or high population stability, causes higher temporal stability, while richness has no effect on stability. Structural equation modelling revealed that imbalance decreases stability indirectly via increasing synchrony and decreasing population stability, explaining 90\% of observed variation. Comparing imbalance derived from single versus multispecies communities demonstrates that fundamental species responses are primary drivers of stability, challenging traditional paradigms emphasizing interspecific interactions. This study provides mechanistic links between species' responses, environmental variability, and ecosystem stability, offering new insights into the responses of ecological systems to environmental change.},

In this work we present a solvable example of such a feedback mechanism in a generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamical system. Beginning with a community of species interacting on a network with arbitrary degree distribution, we provide an analytical framework from which properties of the eventual `surviving community' can be derived. We find that highly-connected species are less likely to survive than their poorly connected counterparts, which skews the eventual degree distribution towards a preponderance of species with low degree, a pattern commonly observed in real ecosystems. Further, the average abundance of the neighbours of a species in the surviving community is lower than the community average (reminiscent of the famed friendship paradox). Finally, we show that correlations emerge between the connectivity of a species and its interactions with its neighbours. More precisely, we find that highly-connected species tend to benefit from their neighbours more than their neighbours benefit from them. These correlations are not present in the initial pool of species and are a result of the dynamics.},

This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks.},

Through extensive use of multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, plot recipes, foreign function interfaces (FFI), and call-overloading, DifferentialEquations.jl offers a unified user interface to solve and analyze various forms of differential equations while not sacrificing features or performance. Many modern features are integrated into the solvers, such as allowing arbitrary user-defined number systems for high-precision and arithmetic with physical units, built-in multithreading and parallelism, and symbolic calculation of Jacobians. Integrated into the package is an algorithm testing and benchmarking suite to both ensure accuracy and serve as an easy way for researchers to develop and distribute their own methods. Together, these features build a highly extendable suite which is feature-rich and highly performant.Funding statement: This work was partially supported by NIH grants P50GM76516 and R01GM107264 and NSF grants DMS1562176 and DMS1161621.

Quantifying ecological stability therefore requires inspecting multiple stability properties, such as resistance, recovery, persistence and invariability. Correlations among these properties can reduce the dimensionality of stability, simplifying the study of environmental effects on ecosystems. A key question is how the kind of disturbance affects these correlations. We here investigated the effect of three disturbance types (random, species-specific, local) applied at four intensity levels, on the dimensionality of stability at the population and community level. We used previously parameterized models that represent five natural communities, varying in species richness and the number of trophic levels. We found that disturbance type but not intensity affected the dimensionality of stability and only at the population level. The dimensionality of stability also varied greatly among species and communities. Therefore, studying stability cannot be simplified to using a single metric and multi-dimensional assessments are still to be recommended.},

An equation derived through an analogy with allosteric enzyme kinetics is given which will account for both Type II and Type III responses. The response behavior can be explained by three parameters: maximal feeding rate (F); an affinity constant (G) related to handling times, capture efficiencies, etc.; and the number of encounters (n) a predator must have with a prey item before becoming maximally efficient at utilizing the prey item as a resource. A discussion follows on the biological processes which result in shifts from Type II to Type III functional responses. Most of the learning processes involve changes in predator behavior associated with increasing encounters with prey, thus supporting parameter n as a major determinant in shifting thc functional response. Three hypotheses concerning the values parameters F, G, and n will assume under different ecological situations are posited: (l) food preferences will be reflected in an increase in resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G) and a decrease in values of n encounters; (2) a size ordering of the predators will result in shifts up in the resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G); while (3) increasing habitat complexity will generate decreases in n and F.},

  abstract = {Declines in European bird populations are reported for decades but the direct effect of major anthropogenic pressures on such declines remains unquantified. Causal relationships between pressures and bird population responses are difficult to identify as pressures interact at different spatial scales and responses vary among species. Here, we uncover direct relationships between population time-series of 170 common bird species, monitored at more than 20,000 sites in 28 European countries, over 37 y, and four widespread anthropogenic pressures: agricultural intensification, change in forest cover, urbanisation and temperature change over the last decades. We quantify the influence of each pressure on population time-series and its importance relative to other pressures, and we identify traits of most affected species. We find that agricultural intensification, in particular pesticides and fertiliser use, is the main pressure for most bird population declines, especially for invertebrate feeders. Responses to changes in forest cover, urbanisation and temperature are more species-specific. Specifically, forest cover is associated with a positive effect and growing urbanisation with a negative effect on population dynamics, while temperature change has an effect on the dynamics of a large number of bird populations, the magnitude and direction of which depend on species' thermal preferences. Our results not only confirm the pervasive and strong effects of anthropogenic pressures on common breeding birds, but quantify the relative strength of these effects stressing the urgent need for transformative changes in the way of inhabiting the world in European countries, if bird populations shall have a chance of recovering.},

A difficult, yet crucial task is to identify food web structures, or food web motifs, that are the building blocks of this baroque network of interactions. Once identified, these food web motifs can then be examined through experiments and theory to provide mechanistic explanations for how structure governs ecosystem stability. Here, we synthesize recent ecological research to show that generalist consumers coupling resources with different interaction strengths, is one such motif. This motif amazingly occurs across an enormous range of spatial scales, and so acts to distribute coupled weak and strong interactions throughout food webs. We then perform an experiment that illustrates the importance of this motif to ecological stability. We find that weak interactions coupled to strong interactions by generalist consumers dampen strong interaction strengths and increase community stability. This study takes a critical step by isolating a common food web motif and through clear, experimental manipulation, identifies the fundamental stabilizing consequences of this structure for ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 733--740 Abstract Here, we review consumer-resource (C-R) theory to show that the paradox of enrichment is a special case of a more general theoretical result. That is, we show that increased energy flux, relative to the consumer loss rate, makes C-R interactions top heavy (i.e., greater C : R biomass ratio) and less stable. We then review the literature on the attributes of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems to argue that empirical estimates of parameters governing energy flux find that aquatic ecosystems have higher rates of relative energy flux than terrestrial ecosystems. Consistent with theory, we then review empirical work that shows aquatic ecosystems have greater herbivore : plant biomass ratios while we produce novel data to show that aquatic ecosystems have greater variability in population dynamics than their terrestrial counterparts. We end by arguing that theory, allometric relationships and a significant, negative correlation between body size and population variability suggest that these results may be driven by the smaller average body sizes of aquatic organisms relative to terrestrial organisms.},

Additionally, we compared two measures of energy use to investigate size--energy use relationships: population metabolism and energy fluxes.

Furthermore, evidence of energetic equivalence was dependent on the estimate of energy use applied (population metabolism or energy flux), the trophic level of consumers, and food web properties.

  abstract = {The insurance effect of biodiversity---that diversity stabilises aggregate ecosystem properties---is mechanistically underlain by inter- and intraspecific trait variation in organismal responses to the environment. This variation, termed response diversity, is therefore a potentially critical determinant of ecological stability. However, response diversity has yet to be widely quantified, possibly due to difficulties in its measurement. Even when it has been measured, approaches have varied. Here, we review methods for measuring response diversity and from them distil a methodological framework for quantifying response diversity from experimental and/or observational data, which can be practically applied in laboratory and field settings across a range of taxa. Previous empirical studies on response diversity most commonly invoke response traits as proxies aimed at capturing species' ecological responses to the environment. Our approach, which is based on environment-dependent ecological responses to any biotic or abiotic environmental variable, is conceptually simple and robust to any form of environmental response, including nonlinear responses. Given its derivation from empirical data on species' ecological responses, this approach should more directly reflect response diversity than the trait-based approach dominant in the literature. By capturing even subtle inter- or intraspecific variation in environmental responses, and environment dependencies in response diversity, we hope this framework will motivate tests of the diversity--stability relationship from a new perspective, and provide an approach for mapping, monitoring and conserving this critical dimension of biodiversity.},

This general result is also found in structurally more complex models (e.g. with space or species interactions). Environmental autocorrelation will also influence evolutionary dynamics as the changing environment is filtered through ecological dynamics. In the context of long-term environmental change, it becomes crucial to understand the potential impacts of different regimes of environmental variation at different scales of organization, from genes to species to communities.},

While work has been done describing and quantifying these changes, little is known about their consequences for species coexistence. Here, we investigate the extent to which changes of species composition impact the likelihood of persistence of the predator--prey community in the highly seasonal Bia{\l}owiez˙a Primeval Forest (northeast Poland), and the extent to which seasonal changes of species interactions (predator diet) modulate the expected impact. This likelihood is estimated extending recent developments on the study of structural stability in ecological communities. We find that the observed species turnover strongly varies the likelihood of community persistence between summer and winter. Importantly, we demonstrate that the observed seasonal interaction changes minimize the variation in the likelihood of persistence associated with species turnover across the year. We find that these community dynamics can be explained as the coupling of individual species to their environment by minimizing both the variation in persistence conditions and the interaction changes between seasons. Our results provide a homeostatic explanation for seasonal species interactions and suggest that monitoring the association of interactions changes with the level of variation in community dynamics can provide a good indicator of the response of species to environmental pressures.},

How much of the coexistence observed in species-rich communities results from indirect effects among competitors that only emerge in diverse systems remains poorly understood. Resolving this issue requires simple, scalable, and intuitive metrics for quantifying the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems, and how these conditions differ from those expected based solely on pairwise interactions. To achieve these aims, we develop a structural approach for studying the set of parameter values compatible with n-species coexistence given the geometric constraints imposed by the matrix of competition coefficients. We derive novel mathematical metrics analogous to stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences that measure the range of conditions compatible with multispecies coexistence, incorporating the effects of indirect interactions emerging in diverse systems. We show how our measures can be used to quantify the extent to which the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems differ from those that allow pairwise coexistence, and apply the method to a field system of annual plants. We conclude by presenting new challenges and empirical opportunities emerging from our structural metrics of multispecies coexistence.},

In particular, the main drivers of environmental change strongly affect the strength of interspecific interactions with considerable consequences for biodiversity. However, extrapolating the effects observed on pair-wise interactions to entire ecological networks is challenging. Here we propose a framework to estimate the tolerance to changes in the strength of mutualistic interaction that species in mutualistic networks can sustain before becoming extinct. We identify the scenarios where generalist species can be the least tolerant. We show that the least tolerant species across different scenarios do not appear to have uniquely common characteristics. Species' tolerance is extremely sensitive to the direction of change in the strength of mutualistic interaction, as well as to the observed mutualistic trade-offs between the number of partners and the strength of the interactions.},

Indices that characterize ecosystem state are helpful tools for the interpretation of ecosystem responses. The central question is how to link these responses to ecosystem structure and functioning and to quantify ecosystem persistence, resistance or resilience. Quantification and characterization of trophic networks by ecological network analysis (ENA) indices is proceeding rapidly, especially in the field of coastal ecology. In this contribution, we review several theories that relate ecosystem structure and function to stability. The structure and functioning of ecosystems change during the maturation of ecosystems. In the first section, the maturation of ecosystems is described using thermodynamics. In the second and third parts of this paper, we define some concepts for analysing structure and functioning of food webs and discuss their relation to stability. In the last section, we describe three ENA indices and their link to stability. We demonstrate that ENA provides powerful tools for describing local stability, combining quantitative and qualitative concepts. However, it remains incomplete for describing real conservation cases that combine local and global stability.},

Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55\% of the variation in plant life-history strategies is adequately characterized using two independent axes: the fast--slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a reproductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative independence of the fast--slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may complement trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; together these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments.},

  abstract = {The group model is a useful tool to understand broad-scale patterns of interaction in a network, but it has previously been limited in use to food webs, which contain only predator-prey interactions. Natural populations interact with each other in a variety of ways and, although most published ecological networks only include information about a single interaction type (e.g., feeding, pollination), ecologists are beginning to consider networks which combine multiple interaction types. Here we extend the group model to signed directed networks such as ecological interaction webs. As a specific application of this method, we examine the effects of including or excluding specific interaction types on our understanding of species roles in ecological networks. We consider all three currently available interaction webs, two of which are extended plant-mutualist networks with herbivores and parasitoids added, and one of which is an extended intertidal food web with interactions of all possible sign structures (+/+, -/0, etc.). Species in the extended food web grouped similarly with all interactions, only trophic links, and only nontrophic links. However, removing mutualism or herbivory had a much larger effect in the extended plant-pollinator webs. Species removal even affected groups that were not directly connected to those that were removed, as we found by excluding a small number of parasitoids. These results suggest that including additional species in the network provides far more information than additional interactions for this aspect of network structure. Our methods provide a useful framework for simplifying networks to their essential structure, allowing us to identify generalities in network structure and better understand the roles species play in their communities.},

Yet, the importance of rare species is much less understood. Here we take a theoretical approach, exposing dynamical models of ecological networks to small perturbations, to explore the dynamical importance of rare and common species. We find that both species types contribute to the recovery of communities following generic perturbations (i.e. perturbations affecting all species). Yet, when perturbations are selective (i.e. affects only one species), perturbations to rare species have the most pronounced effect on community stability. We show that this is due to the strong indirect effects induced by perturbations to rare species. Because indirect effects typically set in at longer timescales, our results indicate that the importance of rare species may be easily overlooked and thus underrated. Hence, our study provides a potential ecological motive for the management and protection of rare species.},

  abstract = {Dynamic food web models describe how species abundances change over time as a function of trophic and life-history parameters. They are essential to predicting the response of ecosystems to perturbations. However, they are notoriously difficult to parameterize, so that most models rely heavily either on allometric scaling of parameters or inverse estimation of biomass flows. The allometric approach makes species of comparable body mass have near-identical parameters which can generate extinctions within a trophic level. The biomass flow approach is more precise, but is restricted to steady-states, which is not appropriate for time-varying environments. Adequately parameterizing large food webs of temperate and arctic environments requires dealing both with many species of similar sizes and a strongly seasonal environment. Inspired by the rich empirical knowledge on the vertebrate food web of the Bia{\l}owie{\.z}a forest, we parameterize a bipartite food web model comprising 21 predators and 124 prey species. Our model is a non-autonomous coupled ordinary differential equations system that allows for seasonality in life-history and predation parameters. Birth and death rates, seasonal descriptions of diet for each species, food requirements and biomass information are combined into a seasonal parameterization of a dynamic food web model. Food web seasonality is implemented with time-varying intrinsic growth rate and interaction parameters, while predation is modelled with both type I and type II functional responses. All our model variants allow for {$>$}80\% persistence in spite of massive apparent competition, and a quantitative match to observed (seasonal) biomasses. We also identify trade-offs between maximizing persistence, reproducing observed biomasses, and ensuring model robustness to sampling errors. Although multi-annual cycles are expected with type II functional responses, they are here prevented by a strong predator self-regulation. We discuss these results and possible improvements on the model. We provide a general workflow to parameterize dynamic food web models in seasonal environments, based on a real case study. This may help to better predict how biodiverse food webs respond to changing environments.},

The combined impact of these factors depends on whether non-native species fill the functional roles of extinct species, thus buffering the loss of functional diversity. This question has been difficult to address, because comprehensive information about past extinctions and their traits is generally lacking. We combine detailed information about extinct, extant, and established alien birds to quantify historical changes in functional diversity across nine oceanic archipelagos. We found that alien species often equal or exceed the number of anthropogenic extinctions yet apparently perform a narrower set of functional roles as current island assemblages have undergone a substantial and ubiquitous net loss in functional diversity and increased functional similarity among assemblages. Our results reveal that the introduction of alien species has not prevented anthropogenic extinctions from reducing and homogenizing the functional diversity of native bird assemblages on oceanic archipelagos.},

High animal diversity increases complementarity of herbivores but also increases feeding rates within the consumer guild. Depending on the balance of these counteracting mechanisms, species-rich animal communities may put plants under top-down control or may release them from grazing pressure. Using a dynamic food-web model with body-mass constraints, we simulate ecosystem functions of 20,000 communities of varying animal diversity. We show that diverse animal communities accumulate more biomass and are more exploitative on plants, despite their higher rates of intra-guild predation. However, they do not reduce plant biomass because the communities are composed of larger, and thus energetically more efficient, plant and animal species. This plasticity of community body-size structure reconciles the debate on the consequences of animal species loss for primary productivity.},

  abstract = {Rare until recently, field-experimental studies of interspecific competition now number well over 150. Competition was found in 90\% of the studies and 76\% of their species, indicating its pervasive importance in ecological systems. Exploitative competition and interference competition were apparent mechanisms about equally often. Few experiments showed year-to-year variation in the existence of competition, though more did in its intensity; many were not long-term. The Hairston-Slobodkin-Smith hypothesis concerning variation in the importance of competition between trophic levels was strongly supported for terrestrial and freshwater systems. In particular, producers, and granivores, nectarivores, carnivores, and scavengers taken together, showed more competition than did phytophagous herbivores and filter feeders. In marine systems, virtually no trend was detectable one way or the other. Large heterotrophs competed more than small ones in most comparisons, and other properties possibly deterring predation, such as stinging behavior, seemed also characteristic of species competing frequently. Among terrestrial plants and certain terrestrial animals but not all, experiments carried out in enclosures were more likely to show competition than unenclosed experiments. A greater ecological overlap implied a greater tendency to compete, as determined experimentally, when niche dimensions were food type or microhabitat; the opposite was true for macrohabitat. A substantial number of studies showed asymmetry in their species' response to competition; larger species were significantly more often superior than smaller ones, though a variety of other apparent reasons for asymmetry also existed. The integration of competition theory into field experimentation has only just begun.}

Here we compare the wider system effects of decreased and increased intrinsic growth rates of species occupying different trophic levels. Specifically, we derive the change in growth rate of a single (focal) species necessary to cause a 90\% reduction in the abundance -- a quasi-extinction -- of another species in model communities. We find that even relatively small changes, negative as well as positive, in the growth rate of the focal species can cause quasi-extinctions of others. Furthermore, the magnitude of change needed to cause a quasi-extinction depends on the trophic level of the perturbed species. The potential ecosystem impact of such `negative' and `positive' changes is largely unknown. We argue that such a targeted decrease or increase could be induced by human interference, such as hunting or harvesting, but also by an outbreak or fade-out of an infectious disease. As ecosystems maintain many and diverse infectious agents, these results suggest that these agents may play an important role in the structure and balance of ecosystems.},

  abstract = {There is a strong trend of declining populations in many species of both animals and plants. Dwindling numbers of species can eventually lead to their functional extinction. Functional, or ecological, extinction occurs when a species becomes too rare to fulfill its ecological, interactive role in the ecosystem, leading to true (numerical) extinction of other depending species. Recent theoretical work on food webs suggests that the frequency of functional extinction might be surprisingly high. However, little is known about the risk of functional species extinctions in networks with other types of interactions than trophic ones. Here, we explore the frequency of functional extinctions in model ecological networks having different proportions of antagonistic and mutualistic links. Furthermore, we investigate the topological relationship between functionally and numerically extinct species. We find that (1) the frequency of functional extinctions is higher in networks containing a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions than in networks with only one type of interaction, (2) increased mortality rate of species having both mutualistic and antagonistic links is more likely to lead to extinction of another species than to extinction of the species itself compared to species having only mutualistic or antagonistic links, and (3) trophic distance (shortest path) between functionally and numerically extinct species is, on average, longer than one, indicating the importance of indirect effects. These results generalize the findings of an earlier study on food webs, demonstrating the potential importance of functional extinction in a variety of ecological network types.},

Warmer communities with less connectivity, shortened food chains and reduced temporal variability were more susceptible to invasions. The directionality and magnitude of invasions effects on food webs varied across temperature regimes. When invaded, warmer communities became smaller, more connected and with more predator species than their colder counterparts. They were also less stable and their species more abundant.

In this study, we present a simple model of a linear food chain and systematically evaluate how stability---measured as invariability---changes with the addition or removal of trophic levels. We identify the presence of trophic cascades in the stability of species. Owing to top-down control by predation and bottom-up regulation by prey, we find that stability of a species is highest when it is at the top of the food chain and lowest when it is just under the top of the food chain. Thus, stability shows patterns identical to those of mean biomass with the addition or removal of trophic levels in food chains. Our results provide a baseline towards a general theory of the effect of adding or removing trophic levels on stability, which can be used to inform empirical studies.},

In both simulated and empirical communities, we show that synchronous and compensatory dynamics are not mutually exclusive but instead can vary by timescale. Our simulations identify multiple mechanisms that can generate timescale-specific patterns, including different environmental drivers, diverse life histories, dispersal, and non-stationary dynamics.

Attention to date has too rarely been directed to relevant ecological endpoints, such as carrying capacity and density dependence. Established procedures are instead based on measuring the Life Tables of individual organisms exposed to differing concentrations of a pollutant at low population density, but this approach does not take into account population effects that may occur through interactions between individuals. Here we introduce an approach that allows direct measurement of the effects of stressors on carrying capacity and density dependence. 2. Using the marine copepod Tisbe battagliai Volkmann-Rocco, we report replicated experiments establishing the effects of 100 {\textmu}g L-1 pentachlorophenol (PCP) in combination with varying diet and food concentrations. Population density was measured as population biomass in 10 mL volumes. Diet was either the alga Isochrysis galbana Parke (here designated `poor diet') or a mix of two algal species (I. galbana and Rhodomonas reticulata Novarino: `good diet'). Each was given at three food concentrations (520, 1300 and 3250 {\textmu}gC L-1), selected on the basis that at low population density these cover the range between limited and maximal population growth. 3. Carrying capacity increased linearly with food concentration. On the poor diet the increase was 1{$\cdot$}2 {$\mu$}g L-1 for each {$\mu$}gC L-1 increase in food concentration. On the good diet the increase was 2{$\cdot$}3 {$\mu$}g L-1/{$\mu$}gC L-1 in the absence of PCP, and 1{$\cdot$}9 {$\mu$}g L-1/{$\mu$}gC L-1 with PCP. Maximum carrying capacity was in the region of 60--80 {$\mu$}g per 10 mL volume. Population growth rate (pgr) decreased linearly with population biomass when the latter was plotted on a logarithmic scale. Increasing biomass reduced pgr by 1{$\cdot$}70 week-1 for each unit increase in log10 biomass. Increasing food concentration and improving diet both increased pgr, but did not affect the slope of the density-dependent relationship. Presence or absence of PCP had no effect except that at some higher food concentrations non-PCP populations initially increased faster than PCP populations, and at high concentration on the good diet the effect of density-dependence was decreased in PCP populations. 4. The results show that a stressor's effects at high population density may differ from its effects at low density, and emphasizes the importance of finding new protocols, such as those introduced here, with which to study the joint effects of a stressor and population density. Managers and researchers of threatened species, harvested species and pest species need to know the joint effects of stressors and population density, in order to be able to predict the effects of stressors on carrying capacity and on the course of recovery from environmental perturbations.},

We estimated this relationship for 1780 time series of mammals, birds, fish, and insects.

This problem, central to community ecology, has elicited a variety of theoretical solutions4,5,6,7, several of which invoke some degree of niche separation in time or space8,9. The signature of niche separation in the field is to be found in community structure, which should indicate (i) smaller than expected niche overlaps on relevant niche axes and (ii) a trade-off between species' resource use on orthogonal axes.

  abstract = {Top-down and bottom-up theories of trophic control have been fundamental to our understanding of community dynamics and structure. However, most ecological theories have focused on equilibrium dynamics and do not provide predictions for communities' responses in temporally fluctuating environments. By deriving the frequency response of populations in different trophic communities, we extend the top-down and bottom-up theories of ecology to include how temporal fluctuations in potential primary productivity percolate up the food chain and are re-expressed as population variability. Moreover, by switching from a time-based representation into the frequency domain, we provide a unified method to compare how the time scale of perturbations determines communities' responses. At low frequencies, primary producers and secondary consumers have the highest temporal variability, while the primary consumers are relatively stable. Similar to the Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis, top-down effects drive this alternating pattern of variability. We define the top-down effect of consumers on the variability of lower trophic levels as a variation cascade. However, at intermediate frequencies, variation cascades can amplify temporal variation up the food chain. At high frequencies, variation cascades weaken, and fluctuations are attenuated up the food chain. In summary, we provide a novel theory for how communities will respond to fluctuations in productivity, and we show that indirect species interactions play a crucial role in determining community dynamics across the frequency spectrum.},

However, the relative functional importance of rare and common species in driving the biodiversity--multifunctionality relationship remains unknown. We studied the relationship between the diversity of rare and common species (according to their local abundances and across nine different trophic groups), and multifunctionality indices derived from 14 ecosystem functions on 150 grasslands across a land-use intensity (LUI) gradient. The diversity of above- and below-ground rare species had opposite effects, with rare above-ground species being associated with high levels of multifunctionality, probably because their effects on different functions did not trade off against each other. Conversely, common species were only related to average, not high, levels of multifunctionality, and their functional effects declined with LUI. Apart from the community-level effects of diversity, we found significant positive associations between the abundance of individual species and multifunctionality in 6\% of the species tested. Species-specific functional effects were best predicted by their response to LUI: species that declined in abundance with land use intensification were those associated with higher levels of multifunctionality. Our results highlight the importance of rare species for ecosystem multifunctionality and help guiding future conservation priorities.},

The assembly graph visually represents assembly dynamics, where nodes symbolize species combinations and edges represent transitions driven by species introductions. Through the lens of assembly graphs, I review how ecological processes reduce uncertainty in random species arrivals (informational approach), identify graphical properties that guarantee species coexistence and examine how the class of dynamical models constrain the topology of assembly graphs (dynamical approach), and quantify transition probabilities with incomplete information (probabilistic approach). To facilitate empirical testing, I also review methods to decompose complex assembly graphs into smaller, measurable components, as well as computational tools for deriving empirical assembly graphs. In sum, this math-light review of theoretical progress aims to catalyze empirical research towards a predictive understanding of ecological assembly.},

A preliminary analysis indicates a relatively high frequency of such interactive species among endangered mammals. Rapid environmental change is likely to increase the interactivity of some species and reduce that of others over relatively short intervals. The current implementation of environmental policies and laws, such as the U.S. Endangered Species Act, generally ignores interspecific effects; recovery goals are autecological, short term, and numerically and spatially minimalistic. Moreover, by failing to account for interspecific interactions, recovery objectives are becoming indefensible in light of increasing knowledge from community ecology. Using the sea otter ( Enhydra lutris ) and wolf ( Canis lupus ) as examples, we argue that conservation plans should call for recovery or repatriation of such interactive species at ecologically effective densities in as many places as are currently realistic. It will be prudent and beneficial to estimate ecologically effective densities where there is disagreement among experts and interested parties about the desirability of restoring an interactive species to a particular region and to a particular density.},

We studied differences in search efficiency between the lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotus; LFV) and the white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus; WBV) foraging on spatiotemporally unpredictable carcasses in Etosha National Park, Namibia. We used experimental food supply and high-resolution GPS tracking of free-ranging vultures to quantify search efficiency and elucidate the factors underlying the observed interspecific differences using a biased correlated random walk simulation model bootstrapped with the GPS tracking data. We found that LFV's search efficiency was higher than WBV's in both first-to-find, first-to-land, and per-individual-finding rate measures. Modifying species-specific traits in the simulation model allows us to assess the relative role of each factor in LFV's higher efficiency. Interspecific differences in morphology (through the effect on perceptual range and motion ability) and searchers' spatial dispersion (due to different roost arrangements) are in correspondence with the empirically observed advantage of LFV over WBV searchers, whereas differences in other aspects of the movement patterns appear to play a minor role. Our results provide mechanistic explanations for interspecific variation in search efficiency for species using similar resources and foraging modes.},

Traditionally, nestedness has been treated in a binary sense: species and their interactions are either present or absent, neglecting information on abundances and interaction frequencies. Extending nestedness to quantitative data facilitates the study of species preferences, and we propose a new detection method that follows from a basic property of bipartite networks: large dominant eigenvalues are associated with highly nested configurations. We show that complex ecological networks are binary nested, but quantitative preferences are non-nested, indicating limited consumer overlap of favoured resources. The spectral graph approach provides a formal link to local dynamical stability analysis, where we demonstrate that nested mutualistic structures are minimally stable. We conclude that, within the binary constraint of interaction plausibility, species preferences are partitioned to avoid competition, thereby benefiting system-wide resource allocation.},

However, the separate roles of self-damping (where a species shows density dependence independent of the densities of other species in the food chain model) and chain length have not been adequately determined. We examined food webs of varying chain length while controlling for self-damping. In contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, we find a weak but significant increase in stability in longer chains when we hold constant the number of species and the number of self-damping terms. Thus, the conclusion that longer food chains are more dynamically fragile, thereby setting an upper limit to food chain length, has at best very limited theoretical support. Our results indicate that community stability should tend to lengthen, not shorten, food chains. Mechanisms limiting the length of food chains remain to be convincingly demonstrated},

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

Using data from 32 empirical food webs, we find that species' roles and dynamic importance are inherent species attributes and can be extrapolated across communities on the basis of taxonomic classification alone.

In particular, microbial communities play a central role in the ecosystem, but we do not understand how changing factors like temperature are going to affect community composition or function. In this article, we studied the self-assembly of multiple communities in synthetic environments to understand changes in microbial community composition based on metabolic responses of different functional groups along a temperature gradient. In many microbial communities, different microbial functional groups coexist through the partitioning of carbon sources in an emergent trophic structure (cross-feeding). In this system, respirofermentative bacteria display a preference for the sugars supplied as the only carbon source but secrete secondary carbon sources (organic acids) that are more efficiently consumed by obligate respirators. As a consequence of this trophic structure, the metabolic plasticity of the respirofermenters has downstream consequences for the relative abundance of respirators across temperatures. We found that the effects of different temperatures on microbial composition can largely be described by an increase in fermentation by-products with increasing temperatures from the respirofermentative bacteria. This research highlights the importance of metabolic plasticity and metabolic trade-offs in predicting species interactions and community dynamics across abiotic gradients.},

  abstract = {Communities are comprised of individual species that respond to changes in their environment depending in part on their niche requirements. These species comprise the biodiversity of any given community. Common biodiversity metrics such as richness, evenness, and the species abundance distribution are frequently used to describe biodiversity across ecosystems and taxonomic groups. While it is increasingly clear that researchers will need to forecast changes in biodiversity, ecology currently lacks a framework for understanding the natural background variability in biodiversity or how biodiversity patterns will respond to environmental change. We predict that while species populations depend on local ecological mechanisms (e.g., niche processes) and should respond strongly to disturbance, community-level properties that emerge from these species should generally be less sensitive to disturbance because they depend on regional mechanisms (e.g., compensatory dynamics). Using published data from terrestrial animal communities, we show that community-level properties were generally resilient under a suite of artificial and natural manipulations. In contrast, species responded readily to manipulation. Our results suggest that community-level measures are poor indicators of change, perhaps because many systems display strong compensatory dynamics maintaining community-level properties. We suggest that ecologists consider using multiple metrics that measure composition and structure in biodiversity response studies.},

Numerous observational studies link rising temperatures to declining biological abundance, richness and diversity in terrestrial ecosystems, yet few studies have considered the highly diverse and functionally significant communities of tropical forest soil and leaf litter fauna. Here, we report major declines in the order-level richness and diversity of soil and leaf litter fauna following three years of experimental whole-profile soil warming in a tropical forest. These declines were greatest during the dry season, suggesting that warming effects could be exacerbated by drought. Contrary to findings from higher latitudes, total faunal abundance increased under warming, and these effects were paralleled by major shifts in community composition. These responses were driven by increased dominance of a relatively small number of thermophilic taxa, and of oribatid mites in particular. Our study provides direct experimental evidence that warming causes diversity declines and compositional shifts for tropical forest soil and leaf litter fauna, a result with potential consequences for soil functions and biogeochemical cycles, and that highlights the vulnerability of tropical biodiversity to climate change.},

Stability describes whether an ecological system will eventually return to its original steady state after being perturbed. More recently, the study of the transient dynamics of ecological systems has been recognized as crucial, given that continuously disturbed systems might never reach a steady state, and thus the instantaneous response to perturbations could largely determine species persistence. A stable equilibrium can be non-reactive---all perturbations decay immediately, or reactive---some perturbations are initially amplified before decaying. Here we derive analytical criteria for the reactivity of large ecological systems in which species interact at random. We find that in large ecological systems both stability and reactivity are governed by the same quantities: number of species, means of the intra- and inter-specific interaction strengths, variance of inter-specific interactions, and the correlation of pairwise interactions. We identify two phase transitions, one from non-reactivity to reactivity and one from stability to instability. As reactivity is an intermediate state between non-reactivity and instability, it could be used to develop an early-warning signal for systems approaching instability.},

  abstract = {Modern coexistence theory (MCT) offers a conceptually straightforward approach for connecting empirical observations with an elegant theoretical framework, gaining popularity rapidly over the past decade. However, beneath this surface-level simplicity lie various assumptions and subjective choices made during data analysis. These can lead researchers to draw qualitatively different conclusions from the same set of experiments. As the predictions of MCT studies are often treated as outcomes, and many readers and reviewers may not be familiar with the framework's assumptions, there is a particular risk of `researcher degrees of freedom' inflating the confidence in results, thereby affecting reproducibility and predictive power. To tackle these concerns, we introduce a checklist consisting of statistical best practices to promote more robust empirical applications of MCT. Our recommendations are organised into four categories: presentation and sharing of raw data, testing model assumptions and fits, managing uncertainty associated with model coefficients and incorporating this uncertainty into coexistence predictions. We surveyed empirical MCT studies published over the past 15 years and discovered a high degree of variation in the level of statistical rigour and adherence to best practices. We present case studies to illustrate the dependence of results on seemingly innocuous choices among competition model structure and error distributions, which in some cases reversed the predicted coexistence outcomes. These results demonstrate how different analytical approaches can profoundly alter the interpretation of experimental results, underscoring the importance of carefully considering and thoroughly justifying each step taken in the analysis pathway. Our checklist serves as a resource for authors and reviewers alike, providing guidance to strengthen the empirical foundation of empirical coexistence analyses. As the field of empirical MCT shifts from a descriptive, trailblazing phase to a stage of consolidation, we emphasise the need for caution when building upon the findings of earlier studies. To ensure that progress made in the field of ecological coexistence is based on robust and reliable evidence, it is crucial to subject our predictions, conclusions and generalisability to a more rigorous assessment than is currently the trend.},

  abstract = {Understanding what determines community assembly and disassembly in a changing environment is a core challenge for ecology. Recently a family of structural stability approaches that determine the range of intrinsic growth rates compatible with system feasibility have been gaining popularity as a measure of how likely a community is able to persist in fluctuating conditions. This offers a theoretical basis for understanding and predicting the assembly and stability of complex multi-species communities from only interaction network structures. However, here I show that the high sensitivity of calculations of the feasibility domain, coupled with empirical uncertainties inherent in estimated interactions, are likely to preclude the approach's reliable application to empirical settings. Across four reanalyses of previous empirical demonstrations of the structural stability approach, more parsimonious explanations based on species connectance provide better explanations for patterns of community assembly or dynamic stability. Calculation of structural stability metrics therefore appears to lose, rather than synthesise, information embedded in empirical interaction matrices. This success of simpler measures is good news for the purposes of prediction and emphasises the value of multiple-competing hypotheses in validation tests to demonstrate value-added associated with new approaches.},

We used a theoretical approach to show that the network architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between trophic and mutualistic networks. A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks. We conclude that strong variations in the stability of architectural patterns constrain ecological networks toward different architectures, depending on the type of interaction.}

Although these studies have been informative, they have usually failed to incorporate either current or predicted future, patterns of variability. Future climates are likely to include extreme events which have greater impacts on ecological systems than changes in means alone. Here, we review the studies which have used experiments to assess impacts of temperature on marine, freshwater and terrestrial communities, and classify them into a set of `generations' based on how they incorporate variability. The majority of studies have failed to incorporate extreme events. In terrestrial ecosystems in particular, experimental treatments have reduced temperature variability, when most climate models predict increased variability. Marine studies have tended to not concentrate on changes in variability, likely in part because the thermal mass of oceans will moderate variation. In freshwaters, climate change experiments have a much shorter history than in the other ecosystems, and have tended to take a relatively simple approach. We propose a new `generation' of climate change experiments using down-scaled climate models which incorporate predicted changes in climatic variability, and describe a process for generating data which can be applied as experimental climate change treatments.},

  abstract = {Biotic interactions are widely recognised as the backbone of ecological communities, but how best to study them is a subject of intense debate, especially at macro-ecological scales. While some researchers claim that biotic interactions need to be observed directly, others use proxies and statistical approaches to infer them. Despite this ambiguity, studying and predicting the influence of biotic interactions on biogeographic patterns is a thriving area of research with crucial implications for conservation. Three distinct approaches are currently being explored. The first approach involves empirical observation and measurement of biotic interactions' effects on species demography in laboratory or field settings. While these findings contribute to theory and to understanding species' demographies, they can be challenging to generalise on a larger scale. The second approach centers on inferring biotic associations from observed co-occurrences in space and time. The goal is to distinguish the environmental and biotic effects on species distributions. The third approach constructs extensive potential interaction networks, known as metanetworks, by leveraging existing knowledge about species ecology and interactions. This approach analyses local realisations of these networks using occurrence data and allows understanding large distributions of multi-taxa assemblages. In this piece, we appraise these three approaches, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Instead of seeing them as conflicting, we advocate for their integration to enhance our understanding and expand applications in the emerging field of interaction biogeography. This integration shows promise for ecosystem understanding and management in the Anthropocene era.},

In a detailed analysis of the Park Grass Experiments at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in England, the author demonstrates that the dramatic results of these 120 years of experimentation are consistent with his theory, as are observations in many other natural communities. The consumer-resource approach of this book is applicable to both animal and plant communities, but the majority of Professor Tilman's discussion concentrates on the structure of plant communities. All theoretical arguments are developed graphically, and formal mathematics is kept to a minimum. The final chapters of the book provide some testable speculations about resources and animal communities and explore such problems as the evolution of "super species," the differences between plant and animal community diversity patterns, and the cause of plant succession.},

Moreover, the main limiting nutrient, soil mineral nitrogen, was utilized more completely when there was a greater diversity of species, leading to lower leaching loss of nitrogen from these ecosystems. Similarly, in nearby native grassland, plant productivity and soil nitrogen utilization increased with increasing plant species richness. This supports the diversity--productivity and diversity--sustainability hypotheses. Our results demonstrate that the loss of species threatens ecosystem functioning and sustainability.},

However, recent research suggests that inverted biomass pyramids (IBPs) characterize relatively pristine reef fish communities. Here, we estimated the slope of a kelp forest fish community biomass spectrum from underwater visual surveys. The observed biomass spectrum slope is strongly positive, reflecting an IBP. This is incongruous with theory because this steep positive slope would only be expected if trophic position decreased with increasing body size (consumer-to-resource mass ratio, less than 1). We then used {$\delta$}15N signatures of fish muscle tissue to quantify the relationship between trophic position and body size and instead detected strong evidence for the opposite, with PPMR {$\approx$} 1650 (50\% credible interval 280--12 000). The natural history of kelp forest reef fishes suggests that this paradox could arise from energetic subsidies in the form of movement of mobile consumers across habitats, and from seasonally pulsed production inputs at small body sizes. There were four to five times more biomass at large body sizes (1--2 kg) than would be expected in a closed steady-state community providing a measure of the magnitude of subsidies.},

This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern--process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes. Monica G. Turner, MacArthur Award Recipient, 2008},

  abstract = {The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

Here, we report the effects of the experimental removal of different PFTs on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in a shrubland ecosystem in central Argentina. 2. On the basis of the biomass-ratio hypothesis and plant resource use strategy theory, we expected the effect of removal of PFTs on AMF colonization and spores to be proportional to the biomass removed and to be stronger when more conservative PFTs were removed. The treatments applied were: undisturbed control (no plant removed), disturbed control (mechanical disturbance), no shrub (removal of deciduous shrubs), no perennial forb (removal of perennial forbs), no graminoid (removal of graminoids) and no annual forb (removal of annual forbs). AMF colonization was assessed after 5, 17 and 29 months. Total density of AMF spores, richness and evenness of morphotaxa, and AMF functional groups were quantified after 5, 17, 29, 36 and 39 months. 3. Five months after the initial removal we found a significant reduction in total AMF colonization in all plots subjected to PFT removals and in the disturbed control plots, as compared with the undisturbed controls. This effect disappeared afterwards and no subsequent effect on total colonization and colonization by arbuscules was observed. In contrast, a significant increase in colonization by vesicles was observed in months 17 and 29, mainly in no graminoid plots. In general, treatments did not significantly affect AMF spores in the soil. On the other hand, no annual forb promoted transient (12--18 months) higher ammonia availability, and no shrub promoted lower nitrate availability in the longer term (24--28 months). 4. Synthesis. Our experiment, the first to investigate the effects of the removal of different PFTs on AMF communities in natural ecosystems, indicates that AMF communities are resilient to changes in the soil and in the functional composition of vegetation. Furthermore, it does not provide consistent evidence in support of the biomass-ratio hypothesis or differential trait-based direct or indirect effects of different PFTs on AMF in this particular system.},

Therefore, the understanding of mechanisms that promote the integrity of those mutualistic assemblages is an important issue for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. In this study we present a new population dynamics model for plant-pollinator interactions that is based on the consumer-resource approach and incorporates a few essential features of pollination ecology. The model was used to project the temporal dynamics of three empirical pollination network, in order to analyze how adaptive foraging of pollinators (AF) shapes the outcome of community dynamics in terms of biodiversity and network robustness to species loss. We found that the incorporation of AF into the dynamics of the pollination networks increased the persistence and diversity of its constituent species, and reduced secondary extinctions of both plants and animals. These findings were best explained by the following underlying processes: 1) AF increased the amount of floral resources extracted by specialist pollinators, and 2) AF raised the visitation rates received by specialist plants. We propose that the main mechanism by which AF enhanced those processes is (trophic) niche partitioning among animals, which in turn generates (pollen vector) niche partitioning among plants. Our results suggest that pollination networks can maintain their stability and diversity by the adaptive foraging of generalist pollinators.},

Here, we computationally assess how adaptive foraging (AF) behaviour interacts with network architecture to determine the stability of plant--pollinator networks. We find that AF reverses negative effects of nestedness and positive effects of connectance on the stability of the networks by partitioning the niches among species within guilds. This behaviour enables generalist pollinators to preferentially forage on the most specialised of their plant partners which increases the pollination services to specialist plants and cedes the resources of generalist plants to specialist pollinators. We corroborate these behavioural preferences with intensive field observations of bee foraging. Our results show that incorporating key organismal behaviours with well-known biological mechanisms such as consumer-resource interactions into the analysis of ecological networks may greatly improve our understanding of complex ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Although alternative stable states are commonly found in simple models, it seems reasonable to assume that the response of real ecosystems to environmental change should often be smoothed by spatial heterogeneity and other stabilizing mechanisms. Here, we systematically explore the effect of spatial heterogeneity on regime shifts for three different models, which we run on a one-dimensional lattice with different spatial distributions of an environmental factor (e.g., soil fertility, water level). If dispersion between patches is negligible, the response to gradual change in some overall stressor (e.g., precipitation, nutrient load) is straightforward. Because of the environmental heterogeneity, each patch shifts to the other stable state at different values of the overall control variable. Therefore, the response of the ecosystem as a whole is gradual (i.e., the average of many asynchronous small shifts) instead of catastrophic. However, in response to a reverse change in the global stressor, the system always shows hysteresis, as each individual patch shifts back to the original state at a different value of the control parameter than the critical threshold for the forward shift. If dispersion between patches occurs, the response to change in the overall control parameter becomes dependent on the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. If the environmental parameter is randomly distributed in space, the overall response tends to remain surprisingly catastrophic, and hysteresis is hardly reduced as compared to the homogeneous case. By contrast, in a smooth environmental gradient, the response of the overall system is gradual, and hysteresis is much smaller. In fact, hysteresis is largely reduced to the initial phases, in which none of the patches have shifted to the alternative state yet. As soon as the first patch shifts, a domino effect occurs, pushing over the neighboring patches. In conclusion, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity may weaken the tendency for large-scale catastrophic regime shifts if dispersion is unimportant or if local environmental characteristics vary along a smooth gradient.},

  abstract = {In making models for biological systems one expects to grasp the biology and be able to use ones intuition to predict the outcome. This paper is about the discrepancy between what is expected and what is the outcome of the analysis of the model, a paradox. The Tilman model of consumers competing for resources has some aspects that may appear counterintuitive. Within the standard Tilman model for a single consumer and a single resource, when a very efficient consumer rapidly eats all available food, the resource density becomes zero, but if there is no food, how can the consumer survive? The paradox can be resolved by realising that in the short term indeed rapid consumption may lead to starvation and a decline in the consumer population, but in the long term a small resource and consumer density remain. A single consumer living on two essential nutrients leaves the density of the non-limiting nutrient above its critical level, so what is done with the extra food? We explain that the extra food is not consumed, just because it is available, but that in fact the additional food is not consumed at all, because the consumer has no use for it. For a model with two consumer species competing for a single nutrient one of the consumers will eventually disappear, even if the food economics of the surviving one is worse and there is still much food wasted. Both are inherent aspects of the model, and the paradox can be avoided if the difference between the consumer species is small, in which case it will take very long to reach equilibrium. We argue that in general an extended stability analysis, in which not only the asymptotically stable state is considered, but also the unstable steady states and all time scales involved in the transient dynamics, gives more insight in the dynamics involved and thus can help in avoiding apparent contradictions in ecological models, or accepting them.},

Reef and demersal fishes are more sensitive to temperature changes than pelagic and bathydemersal fishes. Using a life table, we show that the combined changes of life histories upon increasing temperature tend to facilitate population growth for slow life-history populations, but reduce it for fast life-history ones. Within our data, lower proportions (25--30\%) of slow life-history fishes but greater proportions of fast life-history fishes (42--60\%) show declined population growth rates under 1\,{$^\circ$}C warming. Together, these findings suggest prioritizing sustainable management for fast life-history species.},

In this study, we used community models to examine how complementarity and selection, the two major biodiversity mechanisms known to enhance ecosystem biomass production, affect ecosystem stability. Our analytic and simulation results show that although complementarity promotes stability, selection impairs it. The negative effects of selection on stability operate through weakening portfolio effects and selecting species that have high productivity but low tolerance to perturbations (``risk-prone'' species). In contrast, complementarity enhances stability by increasing portfolio effects and reducing the relative abundance of risk-prone species. Consequently, ecosystem functioning and stability exhibit either a synergy, if complementarity effects prevail, or trade-off, if selection effects prevail. Across species richness levels, ecosystem functioning and stability tend to be positively related, but negative relationships can occur when selection co-varies with richness. Our findings provide novel insights for understanding the functioning-stability relationship, with potential implications for both ecological research and ecosystem management.},

Although inter-specific competition has long been known to be a crucial driver of species coexistence as well, there is a lack of theory investigating the interplay between the structures of competitive and mutualistic networks when jointly considered. Here, we develop an analytical framework to study the structural stability --- the range of conditions under which all species coexist stably, i.e. where the community is both feasible and stable --- of ecological communities in which both mutualistic interactions between plants and pollinators and competitive interactions among plants and among pollinators are present. Using the structure of 50 real networks for mutualistic interactions, combined with analytical and numerical analyses, we show that the structure of the competitive network radically alters the necessary conditions for species coexistence in these communities. Our mathematical framework also allows to accurately characterize the structural stability of these systems. Moreover, we introduce a new metric that accurately links the network structures of competitive and mutualistic interactions to species coexistence. Our results highlight the joint role of the structures of different interaction types to understand the stability of ecological communities and facilitate the analysis of similar natural and artificial systems in which mutualism and competition coexist.},

These `tipping points' are notoriously hard to predict based on trends. However, in the past 20 years several indicators pointing to a loss of resilience have been developed. These indicators use fluctuations in time series to detect critical slowing down preceding a tipping point. Most of the existing indicators are based on models of one-dimensional systems. However, complex systems generally consist of multiple interacting entities. Moreover, because of technological developments and wearables, multivariate time series are becoming increasingly available in different fields of science. In order to apply the framework of resilience indicators to multivariate time series, various extensions have been proposed. Not all multivariate indicators have been tested for the same types of systems and therefore a systematic comparison between the methods is lacking. Here, we evaluate the performance of the different multivariate indicators of resilience loss in different scenarios. We show that there is not one method outperforming the others. Instead, which method is best to use depends on the type of scenario the system is subject to. We propose a set of guidelines to help future users choose which multivariate indicator of resilience is best to use for their particular system.},

  abstract = {Exploration of the relationship between species diversity and ecological stability has occupied a prominent place in ecological research for decades. Yet, a key component of this puzzle---the contributions of individual species to the overall stability of ecosystems---remains largely unknown. Here, we show that individual species simultaneously stabilize and destabilize ecosystems along different dimensions of stability, and also that their contributions to functional (biomass) and compositional stability are largely independent. By simulating experimentally the extinction of three consumer species (the limpet Patella, the periwinkle Littorina and the topshell Gibbula) from a coastal rocky shore, we found that the capacity to predict the combined contribution of species to stability from the sum of their individual contributions varied among stability dimensions. This implies that the nature of the diversity--stability relationship depends upon the dimension of stability under consideration, and may be additive, synergistic or antagonistic. We conclude that, although the profoundly multifaceted and context-dependent consequences of species loss pose a significant challenge, the predictability of cumulative species contributions to some dimensions of stability provide a way forward for ecologists trying to conserve ecosystems and manage their stability under global change.},

  abstract = {A persistent challenge in ecology is to explain the high diversity of tree species in tropical forests. Although the role of species characteristics in maintaining tree diversity in tropical forests has been the subject of theory and debate for decades, spatial patterns in local diversity have not been analyzed from the viewpoint of individual species. To measure scale-dependent local diversity structures around individual species, we propose individual species--area relationships (ISAR), a spatial statistic that marries common species--area relationships with Ripley's K to measure the expected {$\alpha$} diversity in circular neighborhoods with variable radius around an arbitrary individual of a target species. We use ISAR to investigate if and at which spatial scales individual species increase in tropical forests' local diversity (accumulators), decrease local diversity (repellers), or behave neutrally. Our analyses of data from Barro Colorado Island (Panama) and Sinharaja (Sri Lanka) reveal that individual species leave identifiable signatures on spatial diversity, but only on small spatial scales. Most species showed neutral behavior outside neighborhoods of 20 m. At short scales ({$<$}20 m), we observed, depending on the forest type, two strongly different roles of species: diversity repellers dominated at Barro Colorado Island and accumulators at Sinharaja. Nevertheless, we find that the two tropical forests lacked any key species structuring species diversity at larger scales, suggesting that ``balanced'' species--species interactions may be a characteristic of these species-rich forests. We anticipate our analysis method will be a starting point for more powerful investigations of spatial structures in diversity to promote a better understanding of biodiversity in tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Dominance often indicates one or a few species being best suited for resource capture and retention in a given environment. Press perturbations that change availability of limiting resources can restructure competitive hierarchies, allowing new species to capture or retain resources and leaving once dominant species fated to decline. However, dominant species may maintain high abundances even when their new environments no longer favour them due to stochastic processes associated with their high abundance, impeding deterministic processes that would otherwise diminish them. Here, we quantify the persistence of dominance by tracking the rate of decline in dominant species at 90 globally distributed grassland sites under experimentally elevated soil nutrient supply and reduced vertebrate consumer pressure. We found that chronic experimental nutrient addition and vertebrate exclusion caused certain subsets of species to lose dominance more quickly than in control plots. In control plots, perennial species and species with high initial cover maintained dominance for longer than annual species and those with low initial cover respectively. In fertilized plots, species with high initial cover maintained dominance at similar rates to control plots, while those with lower initial cover lost dominance even faster than similar species in controls. High initial cover increased the estimated time to dominance loss more strongly in plots with vertebrate exclosures than in controls. Vertebrate exclosures caused a slight decrease in the persistence of dominance for perennials, while fertilization brought perennials' rate of dominance loss in line with those of annuals. Annual species lost dominance at similar rates regardless of treatments. Synthesis. Collectively, these results point to a strong role of a species' historical abundance in maintaining dominance following environmental perturbations. Because dominant species play an outsized role in driving ecosystem processes, their ability to remain dominant---regardless of environmental conditions---is critical to anticipating expected rates of change in the structure and function of grasslands. Species that maintain dominance while no longer competitively favoured following press perturbations due to their historical abundances may result in community compositions that do not maximize resource capture, a key process of system responses to global change.},

These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our `niche model' extends the existing `cascade model'3,19 and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche20.},

  abstract = {1 Body-size may be an important feature of the structure of food webs. Detailed food web data are however scarce, particularly those including ontogenetic dietary shifts within species. We examined the predator guild in a well characterized food web, that of Broadstone Stream (UK), to assess the importance of body-size within and among species in relation to intraguild predation and niche overlap. 2 In agreement with recent food web theory, mutual predation and cannibalism were frequent and occurred in many pairwise permutations. This intraguild predation was strongly asymmetric, being determined by relative body-size within and among species, and seasonal `ontogenetic reversals' in trophic status arose when generations overlapped. 3 Predator size determined dietary overlap, with ontogenetic shifts often outweighing taxonomic differences. Small predators had the narrowest diets, regardless of species, and were limited to feeding on a restricted subset of the total prey size-spectrum. Niche overlap decreased as pairwise differences in body-size increased among and within species. Overlap in diet also tracked seasonal changes in resource availability, being highest in summer, when prey were abundant and small, and declining progressively over time, as prey became scarcer and/or larger. The small predators also became more detritivorous as prey abundance declined and the larger prey species attained size-refugia. 4 The body-size constraints driving feeding relationships within the predator guild, in terms of both resource partitioning and intraguild predation, lend support to recent niche models of food web structure (Warren 1996; Williams \& Martinez 2000). The highly interconnected food web of Broadstone Stream appeared to be structured by relatively simple rules, with seasonal and ontogenetic shifts in the size-spectrum accounting for most of the changes in predator diet and trophic position. Encounter rate in time (prey and predator mobility) and space (microhabitat use) and foraging mode also influenced prey vulnerability and niche overlap, but were secondary to the effect of body-size.},

  abstract = {Indirect effects occur when the impact of one species on another requires the presence of a third species. They can arise in two general ways: through linked chains of direct interactions, and when a species changes the interactions among species. Indirect effects have been uncovered largely by experimental studies that have monitored the response of many species and discovered "unexpected results," although some studies have looked for specific indirect effects predicted from simple models. The characteristics of such approaches make it likely that the many indirect effects remain uncovered, but the application of techniques such as path analysis may reduce this problem. Deterministic theory indicates that indirect effects should often be important, although stochastic models need exploration. Simulation models indicate that some indirect effects may stabilize multi-species assemblages. Five simple types of indirect effects have been regularly demonstrated in nature: exploitative competition, trophic cascades, apparent competition, indirect mutualism, and interaction modifications. Detailed experimental investigations of natural communities have yielded complicated effects. Indirect effects have the potential to affect evolutionary patterns, but empirical examples are limited. Future directions in the study of indirect effects include developing techniques to estimate interaction strength in dynamic models, deriving more efficient approaches to detecting indirect effects, evaluating the effectiveness of approaches such as path analysis, and investigating mechanisms in which a species changes how other species interact.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities consist of generalists who interact with proportionally many species, and specialists who interact with proportionally few. The strength of these interactions also varies, with communities typically exhibiting a few strong links embedded within many weak links. Historically, it has been argued that generalists should interact more weakly with their partners than specialists and, since weak interactions are thought to increase community stability, that this pattern increases the stability of diverse communities. Here, we studied model-generated predator-prey communities to explicitly investigate the validity of this argument. In feasible communities---those which were both locally stable and all species had positive biomass---we indeed found that species with many predators or prey are affected by them more weakly than species with few. This relationship, however, is only part of the story. While species with many predators (or prey) tend to be only weakly affected by each of them, these many weak interactions are balanced by a few strong interactions with prey (or predators). These few strong interactions are large enough that, when the effect of predator and prey interactions are combined, it seems that species with many interactions actually interact more strongly than species with few interactions. Though past research has tended to focus on either the arrangement of species interactions or the strength of those interactions, we show here that the two are in fact inextricably linked. This observation has implications for both the realistic design of theoretical models, and the conservation of ecological communities, especially those in which the strength and arrangement of species' interactions are impacted by biodiversity-loss disturbances such as habitat alteration.},

According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

Because most works focus either on mutualism or predation, how pollination and herbivory interactively determine the stable coexistence in plant-pollinator-herbivore communities is still poorly understood. Studying the typical three-species module of such communities, we determine the conditions allowing stable coexistence then investigate how its maintenance constrains the relative interaction strengths. Our results show that coexistence is possible if pollination is sufficiently strong relative to herbivory, while its stability is possible if herbivory is sufficiently strong relative to pollination. A balance between pollination and herbivory is therefore required. Interestingly, shared preferences for plant phenotypes, that would favor such balance, have been frequently reported in the empirical literature. The identified ecological trade-off between attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores therefore also appears as an emergent property of stable plant-pollinator-herbivore communities.},

How the interplay of competitive intransitivity and niche overlap jointly affects species coexistence has received little attention. Here, we consider a rock--paper--scissors competition system where interactions between species can represent the full spectra of transitive--intransitive continuum and niche overlap/differentiation under different levels of competition asymmetry. By comparing results from pair approximation that only considers interference competition between neighbouring cells in spatial lattices, with those under the mean-field assumption, we show that 1) species coexistence under transitive competition is only possible at high niche differentiation; 2) in communities with partial or pure intransitive interactions, high levels of niche overlap are not necessary to beget species extinction; and 3) strong spatial clustering can widen the condition for intransitive loops to facilitate species coexistence. The two mechanisms, competitive intransitivity and niche differentiation, can support species persistence and coexistence, either separately or in combination. Finally, the contribution of intransitive loops to species coexistence can be enhanced by strong local spatial correlations, modulated and maximised by moderate competition asymmetry. Our study, therefore, provides a bridge to link intransitive competition to other generic ecological theories of species coexistence.},

Our analyses show that many communities are expected to be `reactive', whereby some~perturbations will be~amplified initially~and generate a response that is directly opposite to that predicted by typical stability measures. In particular, we find reactivity is prevalent for complex communities of mixed interactions and for structured communities, which are both expected to be common in nature.

This question sits at the heart of community ecology and has motivated a large body of theoretical work exploring how community properties shape ecosystem dynamics. However, the overwhelming majority of current theory assumes that species interactions are instantaneous, meaning that changes in the abundance of one species will lead to immediate changes in the abundances of its partners. In practice, time delays in how species respond to one another are widespread across ecological contexts, yet the impact of these delays on ecosystems remains unclear. Here we derive a new body of theory to comprehensively study the impact of time delays on ecological stability. We find that time delays are important for ecosystem stability. Large delays are typically destabilizing but, surprisingly, short delays can substantially increase community stability. Moreover, in stark contrast to delay-free systems, delays dictate that communities with more abundant species can be less stable than ones with less abundant species. Finally, we show that delays fundamentally shift how species interactions impact ecosystem stability, with communities of mixed interaction types becoming the most stable class of ecosystem. Our work demonstrates that time delays can be critical for the stability of complex ecosystems.},

However, long-term persistence of rare species has been difficult to produce in trait-based models of coexistence that incorporate stochastic dynamics, raising questions about how rare species persist despite such variability. Following recent evidence that rare species may experience significantly different population dynamics than dominant species, we use a plant community model to simulate the effect of disproportionately strong negative frequency dependence on the long-term persistence of the rare species in a simulated community. This strong self-limitation produces long persistence times for the rare competitors, which otherwise succumb quickly to stochastic extinction. The results suggest that the mechanism causing species to be rare in this case is the same mechanism allowing those species to persist.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities are inherently dynamic: species constantly turn over within years, months, weeks or even days. These temporal shifts in community composition determine essential aspects of species interactions and how energy, nutrients, information, diseases and perturbations `flow' through systems. Yet, our understanding of community structure has relied heavily on static analyses not designed to capture critical features of this dynamic temporal dimension of communities. Here, we propose a conceptual and methodological framework for quantifying and analysing this temporal dimension. Conceptually, we split the temporal structure into two definitive features, sequence and duration, and review how they are linked to key concepts in ecology. We then outline how we can capture these definitive features using perspectives and tools from temporal graph theory. We demonstrate how we can easily integrate ongoing research on phenology into this framework and highlight what new opportunities arise from this approach to answer fundamental questions in community ecology. As climate change reshuffles ecological communities worldwide, quantifying the temporal organization of communities is imperative to resolve the fundamental processes that shape natural ecosystems and predict how these systems may change in the future.},

When the sizes of direct interactions are determined to within an order of magnitude, the long---term outcomes of press pertubations are highly indeterminate, in terms both of whether species densities increase or decrease and of which interactions have the largest effects. It is emphasized that short---term observations of systems subject to press perturbations (e.g., toxin additions to ecosystems, or experimental manipulations of species using exclosures) are not useful for estimating long---term impacts. The difference between long--- and short---term responses is detailed, and a rule of thumb is given for what constitutes 'long---term' in this context.},

  abstract = {"Plausible" consumer-resource models, based on energetic reasoning and allometric empiricism, are formulated and their dynamics investigated. Most of the parameters in these models are determined by the body sizes and metabolic categories (endotherm, vertebrate ectotherm, invertebrate ectotherm, or plant) of the populations in question. The remaining parameters have clear biological meanings. The intent of these models is to provide maximum realism from minimum data when needed because of constraints of time or of resources for empirical research. The models also demonstrate the influence of physiological power and body size on consumer-resource dynamics. For a given metabolic type, we define ecological scope as the ratio of maximal ingestion rate to respiration rate. Invertebrate ectotherms have greater ecological scope than do vertebrate ectotherms, which have greater scope than do endotherms. Greater ecological scope implies ability to subsist on scarcer resources and a tendency to more stable dynamics. Changes in dynamics associated with increased resource carrying capacity K (the "paradox of enrichment") are investigated. Robust limit cycles (sustained oscillations) require a Type III functional response, but even in this case the cycles quickly "implode" (with respect to changes in K) to extremely small densities if the resource-consumer body mass ratio is too high. Estimates are given for resource-consumer body mass ratios that permit robust limit cycles, and some pertinent data are discussed. An analytic expression for the periods of limit cycles is derived. In terms of body mass, the periods scale as (consumer body mass)1/8 (resource body mass)1/8.},

  abstract = {Plant species in the subfamily Monotropoideae are achlorophyllous and have developed a complex mode of nutrition, receiving photosynthates from neighboring trees via shared fungi. To explore the mycorrhizal associations of Monotropa uniflora in central British Columbia (B.C.), plants were sampled from three sites: a Betula-dominated site and two sites with a mixture of conifer and hardwood trees. Fifteen M. uniflora root-clusters were sampled (five per site) and the mycorrhizal diversity was assessed using morphological and molecular (PCR-RFLP analysis and DNA sequencing) methods. Both methods showed that root-clusters (often comprising several hundred mycorrhizal tips) belonging to the same plant appeared to involve fungus monocultures in the family Russulaceae. All mycorrhizae exhibited typical Russula morphology and had mantle cystidia. Two root-clusters, one each from sites 1 and 3, lacked one of the two types of cystidia present on all other root-clusters. PCR-RFLP analysis resulted in three fragment patterns for the 15 root clusters. One molecular fragment pattern included the two root-clusters displaying the single cystidium type plus an additional root-cluster with both cystidia types. DNA sequencing of a portion of the ITS2 region of the ribosomal DNA suggests that the three variants represent different species; two of the variants clustered with the hypogeous fungi Martellia and Gymnomyces. The study provides increased evidence of low diversity and high specificity in the Monotropa-fungus relationship and suggests that M. uniflora associates uniquely with fungi in the family Russulaceae in central B.C.},

However, they often rely on strong modeling assumptions and expensive numerical integration, requiring significant computational resources and domain expertise. While deep learning (DL) provides efficient alternatives for modeling complex dynamics, they require a large amount of labeled training data. Furthermore, its predictions may disobey the governing physical laws and are difficult to interpret. Physics-guided DL aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods. It has the best of both worlds and is well equipped to better solve scientific problems. Recently, this field has gained great progress and has drawn considerable interest across discipline Here, we introduce the framework of physics-guided DL with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems. We describe the learning pipeline and categorize state-of-the-art methods under this framework. We also offer our perspectives on the open challenges and emerging opportunities.},

Despite decades of efforts to understand ecosystem dynamics and determine whether a tipping point could occur, there are no current approaches to estimate distances (in state/parameter space) to tipping points and compare the distances across various mutualistic systems. Here we develop a general dimension-reduction approach that simultaneously compresses the natural control and state parameters of high-dimensional complex systems and introduces a scaling factor for recovery rates. Our theoretical framework places various systems with entirely different dynamical parameters, network structure and state perturbations on the same scale. More importantly, it compares distances to tipping points across different systems on the basis of data on abundance and topology. By applying the method to 54 real-world mutualistic networks, our analytical results unveil the network characteristics and system parameters that control a system's resilience. We contribute to the ongoing efforts in developing a general framework for mapping and predicting distance to tipping points of ecological and potentially other systems.},

Grassland communities may respond more quickly to novel climates, as they consist mostly of short-lived species, which are directly exposed to macroclimate change. Here we report the rapid response of grassland communities to climate change in the California Floristic Province. We estimated 349 vascular plant species' climatic niches from 829,337 occurrence records, compiled 15 long-term community composition datasets from 12 observational studies and 3 global change experiments, and analysed community compositional shifts in the climate niche space. We show that communities experienced significant shifts towards species associated with warmer and drier locations at rates of 0.0216\,{\textpm}\,0.00592\,{$^\circ$}C\,yr-1 (mean\,{\textpm}\,s.e.) and -3.04\,{\textpm}\,0.742\,mm\,yr-1, and these changes occurred at a pace similar to that of climate warming and drying. These directional shifts were consistent across observations and experiments. Our findings contrast with the lagged responses observed in communities dominated by long-lived plants and suggest greater biodiversity changes than expected in the near future.},
