# Home

This package is a companion to  
[EcologicalNetworksDynamics.jl](https://econetoolbox.github.io/EcologicalNetworksDynamics.jl/),  
extending its functionality in two main directions:

## Post-Processing Simulation Outputs

The package offers a set of utility functions designed to simplify the analysis of simulation results generated by `EcologicalNetworksDynamics`.  
These tools make it easy to:

- Identify surviving species at the end of a simulation,
- Extract the final time steps for targeted analysis,
- And more.

For details, see the [Utilities](@ref) section.

## Measuring Stability

The package also implements a suite of commonly used ecological stability metrics, such as:

- **Resilience**
- **Resistance**
- **Robustness**
- And more.

These metrics can be directly evaluated on dynamical models defined using `EcologicalNetworksDynamics`.

For more information, refer to the [Stability](@ref) section.
